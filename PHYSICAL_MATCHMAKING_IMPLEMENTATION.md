## Files Created/Modified

1. **New Files:**
   - `/src/contexts/PhysicalMatchmakingContext.jsx` - Context provider for state management
   - `/src/components/EnhancedPhysicalMatchmaking.jsx` - Main component with UI
   - `/src/pages/PhysicalMatchmakingPage.jsx` - Page wrapper for the component

2. **Modified Files:**
   - `/src/App.jsx` - Added routes and context provider
   - `/src/components/matchmaking/PhysicalMatchmakingButton.jsx` - Updated to use context

## Integration Instructions

1. **Install Required Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install qrcode.react
   ```

2. **Add the Context Provider:**
   Wrap your application with the `PhysicalMatchmakingProvider` in `App.jsx`:
   ```jsx
   <Router>
     <PhysicalMatchmakingProvider>
       <Layout>
         <Routes>
           {/* Routes */}
         </Routes>
       </Layout>
     </PhysicalMatchmakingProvider>
   </Router>
   ```

3. **Add the Route:**
   Add the route for the physical matchmaking page in `App.jsx`:
   ```jsx
   <Route path="/physical-matchmaking" element={<PhysicalMatchmakingPage />} />
   ```

4. **Update Navigation:**
   Ensure there's a navigation link to the physical matchmaking page.

## Usage

1. **Quick Match:**
   - Select players from the player list
   - Configure match settings (format, best-of)
   - Create matches
   - Record game results

2. **Tournaments:**

   - Edit player information
   - View player statistics
   - Generate QR codes for players

4. **Statistics:**
   - View overall statistics
   - Check top players by rating

   - Track most active players

5. **Data Import/Export:**
   - Export data for backup
   - Import data from another device
   - Share data via QR codes

## Technical Details

1. **State Management:**
   - Uses React Context API for state management
   - Persists data in localStorage
   - Provides methods for CRUD operations on players, tournaments, and matches

2. **UI Components:**
   - Built with React and Tailwind CSS
   - Uses Framer Motion for animations
   - Responsive design for all screen sizes

   - Encodes match and tournament data in JSON format

4. **Offline Support:**
   - Detects online/offline status
   - Works fully offline with localStorage
   - Provides visual indication of connection status

## Bayesian Matchmaking System

1. **TrueSkill Algorithm:**
   - Implemented Microsoft's TrueSkill algorithm adapted for TCGs
   - Player skill represented as a normal distribution with mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ)
   - Conservative rating (μ - 3σ) used for tier placement
   - Uncertainty reduction over time as more matches are played

2. **Match Quality Calculation:**
   - Calculates probability of a close, interesting match
   - Considers skill difference and uncertainty of both players
   - Provides win probability predictions
   - Identifies optimal pairings for tournaments

3. **Rating Updates:**
   - Dynamic rating adjustments based on match outcomes
   - Larger adjustments for unexpected results
   - Smaller adjustments for expected outcomes
   - Uncertainty reduction with each match played

4. **Tier System:**
   - Players assigned to tiers based on conservative rating
   - Multiple divisions within each tier
   - Visual indicators for player skill level
   - Promotion/demotion between tiers based on performance
