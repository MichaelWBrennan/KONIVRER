Human & Celestials
Summary
• Humans are promises that learned to break gently.
• Celestials are agreements that learned to wait.
• Together they build bridges and argue about tolls.

Human
We do not have wings; we have errands. We apologize badly and then better. We break and mend and keep walking.

Celestial
They measure kindness in ledgers that only reduce when shared. Their feathers cut paper and sometimes skin; both bleed ink.

On Companionship
Travel together. One will forget to be brave; the other will forget to be kind. Between them, the valley finds room to forgive.
