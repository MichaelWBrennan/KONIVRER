Summary

• Griots sew time with names.
• In the valley, drums carry news faster than regret.

On Ancestors
Pouring a libation is how a house remembers its foundation. The dead answer with weather: a breeze for approval, still air for correction, rain for forgiveness.

On Spirits and Crossroads
Every crossing wants a song and a small, sweet thing. Those who pay in laughter walk lighter.

Proverbs Collected by the Quiet Hands
- If you go quickly, take a story. If you go slowly, take a friend. If you go wisely, become both.
- The river moves the stone by teaching it a dance.
