Alxemi (Alchemy)
Summary
• Transmutation is repentance that learned technique.
• Gold is not the goal; adequacy is.
• In the valley, the Philosopher’s Stone is a loaf shared correctly.

Prima Materia
Not base matter but base motive: fear, pride, greed. Honest exposure to heat makes it workable.

Operations
Calcination — Burning away excuses.
Dissolution — Letting certainty soften in a kinder solvent.
Separation — Sorting strengths from wounds without contempt.
Conjunction — Reuniting what can respect each other.
Fermentation — Letting joy wake up inside grief.
Sublimation — Teaching the light to rise without leaving.
Coagulation — Allowing the new thing to stay.

Result
The alchemist is changed. Metals follow out of shame.
