Societies & Eras
Summary
• Civilizations persist as echoes around the Veilstone; they remember differently.
• Each society keeps a covenant it cannot keep; each breaks a law it cannot break.
• The valley wears their eras like rings in a felled tree.

Roman Republic (AFE) — The Republic Without a Senate
They keep the forms and have lost the forum. A Curia of ash sits in a barn and votes by the turning of oats in a pail. Their law is a prayer to Earth: measure, weigh, bind. Their coin bears a face no one names; to speak it is treason and mourning both.

Item: Denarius of Ash
A coin struck after the Shattering. It stains the fingers grey. Merchants accept it only at night, when their scales are merciful.

NASA (AFW) — The Astral Hospice
They chart orbits of the unquiet dead. Their telescopes face the ground. Engineers in white smocks salt the floors and speak of trajectories of souls. When a star falls in the Carpathians, they call it a patient who refused to rest.

French Revolution (AIF) — The Red Thermidor
They carry guillotines small enough to wear around the neck. Their liberty is the right to forget the face of a king. They bake bread with blood-warm water and swear never to kneel, then kneel to sharpen the blade.

The Jesuits (AFN) — The Librarians of Names
Their vows forbid mirrors, not books. They catalog angels, demons, and debts—especially the ones that overlap. In twilight they teach the proper way to close a door so a promise cannot follow.

The Amish (AEW) — The Ordinaries
They reject the new not from fear but from memory. Machines invite voices. Voices invite bargains. They plow the fields with iron that has forgotten its former shape: a nail, a coin, a hairpin from a saint.

Victorian Era Britain (AIE) — The Brass Empathy
Steam and sorrow. A parliament of widows writes laws for ghosts: taxes on hauntings, guilds for mediums, a workhouse for time. They export mourning clothes that never fade.

Humanitarian Orders (AIW) — The Quiet Hands
They go where the river runs backward, where the bread rises without yeast. They learn to bandage the world and refuse payment. In their tents the candles do not flicker; even the wind is respectful.

Utopian Movements (ANW) — The Perfect Circle
They draw diagrams in salt and live inside them. Their towns have no corners; sin collects in corners. They call all children Pilgrims and all elders Witnesses. The door to each house is also an apology.

Venetian Republic (AIN) — The Drowned Ledger
They trade in debts that cannot be paid. Gondolas drift through mountain fog as if the valley had grown canals in its sleep. A Doge elected by ravens decrees: every promise must be weighed against a button.

Era-Rings of the Valley
- Pre-History of Mists — People were told not to be born yet and many obeyed.
- Classical of Brass — Law learned to count; mercy learned to lie.
- Age of Ash — The Veilstone remembered its first crack and asked for another.

All of these are true. None explain anything. The Pilgrim walks through them like a knife through bread, taking only what hunger allows.
