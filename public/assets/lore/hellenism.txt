Hellenism (AIFEW)
Summary
• Gods are arguments about excellence that learned to drink wine.
• Fate is a rope braided from choices you thought were small.
• In the valley, oracles answer with questions that make you kinder.

Olympians in Exile
Zeus no longer throws lightning; he chairs meetings about storms. Athena teaches children to lose well. Hermes collects buttons and stories and insists they are the same coin.

Rites
Libation to strangers, hymns to shared courage, games where winners carry losers home on their shoulders.
