Dharmism (AINEW)
Summary
• Duty is the shape of love when it becomes reliable.
• Karma is not punishment; it is the kindness of consequences learning your name.
• In the valley, right action is often small and terribly exact.

Dharma and Pilgrimage
Do the next right thing even if no tale will be told of it. Lay a stone back where you found it. Offer water before words.

On Karma
Every deed writes the world a little truer. Untruth returns as confusion; truth returns as the absence of regret.

Yogas Under the Veil
Bhakti — Love that refuses to count.
Karma — Work that cleans as it builds.
Jnana — Knowledge that bows before it speaks.
Raja — Discipline that keeps time with mercy.
