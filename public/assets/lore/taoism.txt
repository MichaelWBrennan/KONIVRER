Taoism (AIFNW)
Summary
• The Way in a cracked world flows around the crack and becomes it.
• Doing without forcing, speaking without insisting, mending without boasting.
• Yin and yang as doors: one opens in, one opens out.

On the Way
In Valea Căpcănești, a sage points to a fallen wall and says, “This is how a river thinks.” Pilgrims learn to move like water that refuses to drown what it loves.

Wu Wei
Act when the world is already leaning where you mean to go. Candles that do not flicker are lying—open a window and let the truth move.

Five Phases in a Valley of Six
Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water cycle as always. Aether watches like a patient official; Nether keeps the minutes. Harmony is not absence of grief; it is grief that does not rot.

Practice
Brew tea for a stranger. Repair a fence you did not break. Speak less than you know and mean all of it.
