Laws & Pre-History
Summary
• Before law, the river counted. After law, we pretended to.
• The first covenant weighed rain against names.
• The Shattering did not break the law; it revealed its exceptions.

Bone Laws
Hunters tallied seasons by notches on a stag’s rib. Each mark forgave a hunger taken without cruelty. To break Bone Law is to eat what begged you to spare it.

Clay Laws
Merchants stamped reeds into wet earth. The clay remembered who owed whom and how much salt a promise was worth. Fire baked the debt into truth.

The Covenant of the Veilstone
Priests and kings swore to keep breath and breathless from paying each other’s fines. The Veilstone stood as witness. When it cracked, witnesses were everywhere and nowhere.

Modernities
Parliaments legislate hauntings; monasteries notarize apologies; engineers draw up bridges for the dead to cross politely. None of this ends grief. It gives it paperwork.

Pre-History’s Return
The older laws come back in muddy shoes. A Pilgrim does well to learn them: do not steal what was offered, do not refuse what was returned, do not name a thing you would be ashamed to meet.
