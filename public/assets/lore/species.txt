Species (Ogre, Dvergr, etc.)
Summary
• Peoples in the valley are habits given inheritance.
• Names carry laws; laws carry names.
• Hospitality binds all.

Ogre
Hunger counted and leashed. They keep guest-right with ferocity. Their tables are large and their tempers small when fed.

Dvergr
Trade in equities of memory. They can sell you back a lost hour if you can afford the regret.

Dryad
Trees that learned to walk away from axes. They protect children and punish fires that forget they are guests.

Wight
The dead who stayed to finish a chore. Help them and they rest. Cheat them and you inherit their chore.
