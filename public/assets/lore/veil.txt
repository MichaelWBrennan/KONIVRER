The Veilstone, an ancient artifact that separated the realms of the living and the dead, has shattered. In its wake, Romania has become a cursed land haunted by gods, spirits, and demons. Players take the role of broken individuals drawn into this fragmented world. Their choices will reshape the land, influence the balance between life and death, and determine whether the Veilstone is restored—or used to transcend mortality.
