Aether Magic System
Summary
• Aether binds by consent and punishes by clarity.
• Spells are promises woven tightly enough to touch.
• Every working leaves a receipt; keep them.

Threadwork
Aether is spun from intention. The cleanest thread comes from a vow spoken aloud and paid for with an inconvenience you chose in advance.

Knots (Seals)
Knots fix a truth in place. A gatekeeper’s knot opens only outward. A wedding knot refuses to burn. A liar’s knot unravels when watched.

Weaves (Rites)
Patterns of knots: hospitality, witness, penance. Cast not with flourish but with preparation—warm bread on the table, water clean enough to see your shame in.

Counterseals
Every knot admits a twin. Mercy unbinds punishment; apology unbinds pride. The most dangerous counterseal is Forgetting; use it only to rescue, never to erase a debt.

Costs and Risks
Cost is paid in memory or reputation. Aether dislikes bargains struck in ignorance; it takes payment in advance by making you kinder than you meant to be.

Practice
Carry twine. Tie a loop before you speak, cinch it when you are believed, cut it only after you have done what you said.
