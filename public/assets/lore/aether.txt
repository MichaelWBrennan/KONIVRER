Aether Magic System
Summary
• Aether binds by consent. Clear words act like a ligature: they hold what you intend.
• A working has four parts: thread (vow), knot (ligature), weave (suture pattern), counterseal (release).
• Every working leaves a receipt or mark; keep it so others may read your practice.
• Set the fee first. Payment is in memory or reputation; never work in ignorance.

Threadwork
Form the thread from a spoken vow in a clear voice. As apothecaries weigh by drachm and scruple, set the fee beforehand. Keep a steady regimen: do not work fasting, drunk, or in anger. A clean thread is made from a simple promise paid with a small, chosen inconvenience.

Knots (Seals)
Knots are ligatures that fix the effect in place. Use the simplest ligature that serves the purpose, and prepare a gentle release. A gatekeeper’s ligature opens only outward; a marriage ligature does not take the flame; a liar’s ligature fails under witness.

Weaves (Rites)
A weave is a suture pattern made from knots. Set the field as surgeons do: clean water, warm bread, decent hospitality, honest witness, and penance for wrongs. Prefer cleanliness and order to show and flourish.

Counterseals
Every ligature admits a remedy. Mercy loosens punishment; apology reduces the swelling of pride. The sharp counterseal is Forgetting: treat it as cautery, used only to rescue when all gentler means fail—not to erase a rightful debt.

Costs and Risks
Payment is in memory or good name. Aether rejects bargains made in ignorance and takes its fee in advance by making you kinder than you planned. Common mishaps: adhesion (a seal that will not release), a cold rite (no hospitality), false witness, and misuse of Forgetting that leaves scar in place of cure.

Practice
Carry twine. Tie a loose loop before you speak, cinch it when you are believed, and cut it only after you have done what you promised. Leave a receipt: a small knot, a line in the book, or a token, so any colleague can read what was done.
