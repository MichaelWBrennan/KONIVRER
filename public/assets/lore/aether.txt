Canon Aetheris Medicus (c. 1500)
Summary
• Aether flows in the body as breath and motive; it pools at gates and deep basins called lamps.
• Names differ across lands—ruach/pneuma, prāṇa, qì, pneûma, àṣẹ/nyama, and field‑breath—but the care is one.
• Begin with breath, posture, touch, and food; only then apply needle, heat, or sharp measures.
• Work not in rage, fasting, or fresh mourning. Favor gentle loosening before any cautery.

De Eadem Re Sub Variis Nominibus (One Matter under Many Names)
Abrahamism — Breath/Grace (ruach, pneuma). Gates of heart and throat; right hand covenant, left memory. Balancing by prayer, confession, anointing oils, and pilgrimage fasts.
Dharmism — Prāṇa. Nāḍīs (iḍā, piṅgalā, suṣumṇā) and seven lamps (cakras). Balancing by breath‑disciplines, seats and locks; herbs warming or cooling the doṣas.
Taoism — Qì. Meridians with source, well, river, stream, and sea points. Balancing by acupressure/needling, moxa, seasonal diet, and quiet standing.
Hellenism — Pneûma. Organs as furnaces; humors carry heat and motion. Balancing by hot/cold, dry/moist; pulse, baths, and simples.
African Lore — Vital force (àṣẹ, nyama). Lines of kin and place; crown, palms, soles as bright gates. Balancing by invocation, rhythm, palm‑oils, smoke, elders’ blessing.
Wildfolkism — Field‑breath. Hollows where wind pools: nape, kidneys, knee crooks. Balancing by offerings, bone‑charms, and slow songs to unbind fright.

Septem Lucernae (The Seven Lamps)
• Crown (Lamp of Kings): Fontanelle, midline. Suṣumṇā/DU meets REN; ancestral line joins. Brightens; wastes if grief is sealed.
• Brow (Lamp of Counsel): Between the eyes. Iḍā/Piṅgalā braid; Yin/Yang cross. Clears sight; scatters with excessive vigil or false lights.
• Throat (Lamp of Oaths): Above the notch. Sea of qì; gate of covenant breath. Gives voice; tightens with swallowed words.
• Heart (Lamp of Mercy): Sternum’s center. Great meeting of channels; seat of intention. Warms limbs; chills with resentment.
• Solar (Lamp of Resolve): Below xiphoid. Middle burner; river of food‑fire. Digests worries; flares with pride, sinks with shame.
• Navel (Lamp of Stewardship): At the umbilicus. Sea of blood; srotas distribute. Stores strength; leaks with over‑giving.
• Root (Lamp of Keeping): Perineal gate. Gate of essence; ming‑men behind. Holds life; freezes with fear, bleeds with excess heat.

Tabella Querelarum (Common Complaints and Gentle Treatments)
• Head wind (scatter‑thought, moving pain): Qì ascends unruly; iḍā/piṅgalā unpaced. Treatment: press brow gate; warm feet; lengthen exhale; avoid bitter at night. Caution: do not needle crown in grief’s first three days.
• Chest tightness (unshed speech): Throat/heart bound by withheld word. Treatment: rub sesame with thyme over sternum; sing psalm or mantra; open windows. Caution: avoid sharp heat if tongue is dry and red.
• Cold hands, quick anger: Fire trapped at solar; earth drained at navel. Treatment: ginger decoction; knead the thenar well; walk until sweat pearls. Caution: avoid strong purges in winter.
• Night‑terrors (fright wind): Root gate startled; essence scattering. Treatment: warm milk with nutmeg; bind an iron button at ankle gate; ancestor prayer. Caution: children receive touch and song, not needles.

Maxima (Brief Maxims)
• Begin with breath and posture; then touch and food; lastly needle or fire.
• Reconcile words by the patient’s steadied breath when traditions differ.
• Keep receipts in habit: note pulse, breath count, and what soothed.
• When the small voice is threatened, protect it first; repair the strong later.
