Japa Rope
Knotted to count mercies offered. When the Pilgrim lies, a knot slips. When they forgive, a new knot appears between two old ones.

Rice Bowl of Returning
Refills if the owner gives the first portion to someone who will not say thank you.

Ox-Herder’s Whistle
Summons the lost self from reeds by the river. The one who answers may not be the one who left.

Pressed with a hole for thread. Used to pay tolls to ferrymen who only carry those who doubt they deserve it.
