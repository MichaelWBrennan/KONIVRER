Their ledgers balance. They prefer fair bargains to stolen victories. They will walk away if you are cruel to the wrong thing.

Mythological
Hydras are grudges that learned to grow back. Gorgons are truths that refused to be seen too quickly. Minotaurs are maps without exits; offer them a door.

Etiquette
Bow without lowering your eyes. Speak the price before the wish. Leave a button.
