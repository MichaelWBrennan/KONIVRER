Basik AnglΣ (Language)
Summary
• A language cleaned for honesty, scratched for memory.
• Diacritics mark debts: words owe meaning to the marks they wear.
• In the valley, speech is binding when spoken kindly and precisely.

Rules of the Tongue
- Short words first; truth does not need stairs.
- Σ marks threads of shared sense; readers are invited to pull.
- Double letters indicate promises doubled: better, letter, bitter—be careful which you send.

Borrowings
From Latin, the habit of law; from Greek, the habit of asking; from Slavic, the habit of weather.

On Oaths
Said three times, an oath becomes round and rolls back if wrong. Write it once to rest it.
