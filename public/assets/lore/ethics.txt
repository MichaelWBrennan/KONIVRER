Ethics Systems
Summary
• In the valley, ethics are choices of weight, not of noise.
• Each Element offers a stance; none absolves you of the others.
• Good is what keeps the bridge standing after you cross.

Six Stances
- Aether (Principle): Do right even when it costs you the story you prefer.
- Air (Adaptation): Teach and learn until the tool fits the hand and the hour.
- Fire (Aspiration): Protect as you build; make better without making proud.
- Earth (Integrity): Weigh fairly; verify gently; keep standards kind.
- Water (Potential): Connect what cannot agree; let possibility breathe.
- Nether (Capability): Design the steps; make it doable; be brave about limits.

Conflicts and Repairs
When stances quarrel, choose the one that protects the smallest voice and leaves the least to regret. Later, make amends with the one you neglected.

Pilgrim’s Rule
Do not seek to be right; seek to be responsible. If you cannot be both, leave a button and try again tomorrow.
