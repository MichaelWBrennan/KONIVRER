Origin of Species: Mythological Clades
Summary
• The Shattered Veil rewrites stories until they breed true.
• Clades in the valley are debts that learned to stand up.
• Bloodlines behave like promises: binding when kept, dangerous when broken.

Human — Those Who Must Choose
The weakest magic, the strongest oath. Humans anchor the other clades by asking for reasons and paying with memory.

Celestial — Agreements Wearing Bodies
Not born; contracted. Their wings are metaphors made inconveniently real. They leave feathers where terms change.

Infernal — Appetites Under Law
They hunger cleanly. They keep schedules. If you must deal, deal at noon where shadows are shortest.

Dvergr — Stone Memory
A people of ledgers hammered into iron. They sell names back to those who misplaced them. They will buy your silence if it is well made.

Ogre — Census of Hunger
Counted by threes: appetite, shelter, regret. They eat what is offered with sincerity and despise deceit more than starvation.

Wildfolk — Boundaries with Legs
They patrol where field becomes forest and daylight forgets itself. Their laws are simple and teeth are their bailiffs.

Liminal — Keepers of Crossings
Gatekeepers, ferrymen, those who know which way the wind owes. They are paid in buttons and in the secret that no one else wanted.

On Convergence
Clades blend along old roads. A Pilgrim may find herself speaking truth like a Dvergr and mourning like a Celestial by winter’s end. The valley is patient with mixed debts.
