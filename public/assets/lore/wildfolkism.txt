Wildfolkism (AIFNE)
Summary
• The forest keeps its own minutes and enforces them with teeth.
• Laws are simple: do not waste, do not boast, do not poison belonging.
• In the valley, trails are written by forgiveness more than by feet.

Totems and Trials
A Pilgrim will be asked to feed a rival, free a snare, and admit the name of a fear. Passing any two earns passage; failing all three earns a lesson.

Blessings
Moss that warms in winter only for the generous. Water that tastes of almonds only when carried uphill for someone else.
