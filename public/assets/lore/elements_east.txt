Elements (Eastern Flavor)
Summary
• Everything feeds and restrains everything else; mercy and restraint are twins.
• Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water: habits of a world with a cracked rhythm.
• The valley obeys the cycles until pilgrims ask the right questions.

Wood — The Kept Promise
Green that remembers a hand. Doors and bridges belong to this. Wood grows toward obligations and leans away from lies.

Fire — The Speaking Desire
Warmth that wants an audience. Fire teaches food to be honest and men to be careful.

Earth — The Expectant Witness
Soil waits longer than sin. Buried things are not gone; they are being considered.

Metal — The Severe Memory
Steel returns to the shape of the oath it was forged to keep. It will not forgive but it can be remade.

Water — The Willing Path
Water chooses the gentlest descent and arrives everywhere. It remembers knees better than faces.

On Cycles
Generating: Wood feeds Fire, Fire makes Earth, Earth bears Metal, Metal enriches Water, Water nourishes Wood.
Restraint: Wood parts Earth, Earth dams Water, Water cools Fire, Fire softens Metal, Metal prunes Wood.

Pilgrim’s Practice
Carry a wooden token for beginnings, a coin for memory, a flask for humility. Fire and Earth will attend uninvited.
