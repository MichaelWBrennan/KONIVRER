Summoning
Summary
• Doors open easily; closing them is the cost.
• Courtesy is binding. Precision is armor.
• Never invite what you would not apologize to afterward.

A Rite in Three Mistakes
1) Draw the circle slightly wrong on purpose. Perfection invites pride; pride invites company.
2) Name what you call correctly, then call it by a gentler title. Let it choose which to answer to. You will learn who is visiting.
3) Pay with something you expected to keep: a remembered insult, your right to the last word, a button from your warmest coat.

Aftercare
Sweep sunwise, then widdershins. Thank aloud the space that remained empty. Feed a stray animal within the day. Sleep with your shoes near the door.

Warnings Collected at Saint Ilie’s
- Never bargain on an empty stomach. Hunger signs documents the heart cannot read.
- Candles that do not flicker are lying. Open a window and start over.
- If the wind knows your name, lend it a different one for the hour.
