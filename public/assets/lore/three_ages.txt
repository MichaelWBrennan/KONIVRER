Three Ages
Summary
• Ash remembers the flame without resenting it.
• Brass remembers the mold it filled and honors it.
• Mist remembers everything and tells nothing.

Age of Mist
Hospitals for weather. Names were suggestions. The kind learned to rule because they were patient enough to wait their turn.

Age of Brass
Standards, measures, bridges. Justice arrived with weights; mercy arrived with bread.

Age of Ash
After the Shattering. What survives now does so by being worth carrying.
