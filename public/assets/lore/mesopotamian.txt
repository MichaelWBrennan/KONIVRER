Hidden Mesopotamian Pantheon
Summary
• The first contracts were written on wet clay and dried in sunlight that never set.
• Their gods do not sleep; they are negotiated with.
• In the valley, their temples are ditches that fill when it rains.

The Nameless River
Before the Veil had a stone, it had a current. Priests without mouths weighed reeds against bones and learned that silence floats. They called the current a god because it was patient.

Anu Above, Ki Below
The sky was a lid, the earth a bowl. Between them people learned to be food. After the Shattering, the lid loosened; things fell in and out politely. The bowl cracked where Valea Căpcănești now sits and the soup still remembers the first taste of iron.

Enki’s Debt
Enki taught names the trick of holding shape. He lent the trick to kings, then to beggars. The trick returned broken, as all tools do. Now every name is owed two meanings: what it is, and what it will cost.

Inanna’s Descent (As Told by a Monk of Saint Ilie)
She wore power like rings and bargains like perfume. At each gate she traded a certainty for a rumor. When she returned she was still herself, only more expensive. This is the oldest lesson of the Veil.

On Tablets Found in the Bran Archive
- A wedge for water, a wedge for blood. Confuse them and the dead learn to thirst.
- A seal of a lion fighting a bull. The lion is Summer. The bull is Debt.
- A prayer for merchants: “May my weights be heavier in the sight of Heaven than they are in my hand.”

The Hidden Kings
Not gods, not men. Administrators of crossings. Their crowns are scales, their scepters ledgers, their palaces bridges. They remember the time before borders and enforce it retroactively.

Why They Are Hidden
Because people prefer miracles to bureaucracy. But when the river rises, the clerk with the driest feet is holy.

Rituals That Do Not Fail
- Burn barley and pour out clean water. Invite the king who never arrives. He will be grateful for your disappointment.
- Write your desire on clay and do not bake it. If it dissolves, it was unworthy. If it survives the rain, it is already yours and you will pay accordingly.

Pilgrim’s Note
The Mesopotamian gods did not return. They were already here, employed as metaphors by whatever owns the Veilstone. Treat them as officials, and bring extra buttons.
