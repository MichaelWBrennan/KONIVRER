Worlds & Lokas
Summary
• The valley sits where ladders of worlds lean against one another.
• Realms are not places but moods that learned geography.
• Crossings open for those who owe, and for those who forgive.

The Three Layers Most Pilgrims Survive
- Overworld — The Aetheric Canticle. Sky that thinks in hymns. Angels file reports here and seal them with weather.
- Midworld — The Mortal Weave. Fields, wells, and rooms that remember arguments. The valley is the knot everyone feels beneath their feet.
- Underworld — The Patient Ledger. Call it Naraka if you like; it will not mind. It is not punishment; it is accounting with fire and shadow.

Lokas Along the Grain
- Devaloka — Where kindness arrives before need. Rest is a tax; the rich in virtue grow sleepy.
- Asuraloka — Where strength is owed a reason. Quarrels bloom like roses. Victory tastes of copper and apology.
- Pretaloka — Where hunger is a language. Doors smell like kitchens. A full stomach forgets how to speak.
- Manusyaloka — Where we are allowed to choose. The only realm that envies none of the others.

Other Western Names for the Same Mist
- The Aetheric Sea, the Charcoal Halls, the Nether Roads. Names save no one; true routes are learned by walking.

On Crossings
- Veilstone Shards open doors that quickly remember they are doors.
- Bridges of Prayer carry one pilgrim at a time; two will learn to swim.
- Thresholds love to be paid in buttons.

A Pilgrim’s Chart
Walk sunwise to remember, widdershins to repent. When lost, speak the nicest lie you ever refused to tell; the world will reward you with an honest path.
