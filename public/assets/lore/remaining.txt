Remaining Orders (Archangels, etc.)
Summary
• The highest do not appear; they arrange.
• Their signs are consequences that arrive early or late.
• They speak in ledgers, not in lightning.

Michael — Weight and Edge
Felt as the moment a blade becomes heavier on one side and the argument ends. The victory is clean and the appetite afterward is small.

Gabriel — Kept Message
The letter arrives one day late and saves two lives from haste. Trumpets are for parades; this one uses silence.

Raphael — Thread of Hands
Where wounds meet, a warmth like gratitude without object. He binds skill to mercy so that neither is shamed.

Uriel — Ember that Watches
In the monastery ovens a coal refuses to die. It remembers every loaf shared without counting. Those who steal from it lose their fear of winter.

Metatron — The Narrow Ledger
He is the margin that grows when you write in it. A tally of vows that becomes smaller as it is added to correctly. One may walk it like a narrow bridge.

On Petition
Ask nothing grand. Ask for the faith to leave a door unlocked for a neighbor you misjudged. The Orders will not change the river; they will teach your feet the shallow places.
