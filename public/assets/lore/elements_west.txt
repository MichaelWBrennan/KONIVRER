Elements (Western Flavor)
Summary
• Old alchemists wrote in circles to keep their truths from running away.
• In the valley, each element is a habit the world would rather not break.
• These notes are marginalia found in a water-damaged Rosarium.

Earth — The Patient Measure
Stone does not forgive; it remembers. The pilgrim who sets a weight upon the scale of Earth will find the other pan already heavy with uncounted favors.

Air — The Unowned Breath
Air is a promise to return. Doors opened to Air never truly close; they only pretend until death passes by.

Fire — The Desiring Ash
What burns wishes it could stay. The ash wishes it could leave. Between them the pilgrim warms his hands and learns neither is satisfied.

Water — The Second Thought
Water believes the mountain was always a river. It persuades rock with patience and bodies with mercy.

Aether — The Gentle Tyrant
Aether binds by convincing you that you were already bound. It is the order of prayers and the silence between.

Nether — The Useful Absence
What is missing shapes what remains. The Nether is the draft left by a word unsaid. It is not evil. It is a tool; it resents being named.

On Mixtures (Notes for the Careful)
- Earth with Air tastes of bread—sturdy, risen, shared. Good for promises in daylight.
- Earth with Water grows graves into gardens. Do not plant what you are not ready to harvest.
- Fire with Water makes steam that blinds and heals. A surgeon’s breath.
- Fire with Aether becomes doctrine; keep a basin nearby for when it cools.
- Water with Aether is a mirror that shows you as someone else would forgive you.
- Aether with Nether is the Veil’s favorite deceit: a door that is also an oath.

The alchemists did not agree about any of this. Agreement is for those whose world is not cracked.
