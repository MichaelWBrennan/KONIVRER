Abrahamism (IFNEW)
Summary
• Covenants are bridges with nails of mercy.
• In the valley, altars are built low so strangers may sit on them.
• Faith measures what you keep when the world miscounts you.

Patriarchs and Valleys
Abraham left; the valley stays. Both are obedience. A pilgrim who refuses a cruel test is honored by an angel with clean hands.

Law and Prophets
Law draws lines for safety. Prophets relocate them for love. Between them the poor find a door they can reach.

Rituals That Hold
Sabbath — A day that forgives work for the sin of thinking it was the point.
Tithe — A gift that humiliates greed until it learns to be grateful.
Hospitality — Bread broken to break curses.
