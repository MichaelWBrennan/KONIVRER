Shem HaMephoras (72 Angels)
Summary
• Seventy-two names written on breath; each corrects a debt in silence.
• They do not wage war on devils; they audit them.
• In the valley their miracles are small and irreversible.

On Names as Ladders
Every true name is a rung that does not break under weight. The Pilgrim ascends by confessing what each rung costs. The angels do not catch those who fall; they shorten the distance.

Selected Intercessions
- Vehuiah — First among dawns. Corrects rash vows with morning. A bargain made at midnight counts as a dream by sunrise if this name is remembered.
- Jeliel — Weaver of quarrels into single cloth. He does not choose sides; he chooses seams. Two lamplighters, once rivals, now share one wick.
- Sitael — Shield against mistaken arrows. The wolf sees no child when this name is near, and the child does not learn to be proud of not being eaten.

Method
Names are written on air with warm breath and held in the mouth like a coin. The offering is a button, a drop of clean oil, or a letter never sent. Speak kindly and precisely. Kindness opens the door; precision keeps it from opening too far.

Oppositions and Custody
Each Goetic title has a counter-signature. The counter is not a weapon but a receipt. When a demon grants a thing, the angel ensures the cost is paid in a currency the soul can afford.

Pilgrim’s Note
Expect no thunder. Expect the quill to fail when it should, the rope to hold when it looks tired, the child to sleep through the hour you planned to break a promise.
