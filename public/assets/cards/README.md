# Card Images

Card images are now served from GitHub CDN to reduce deployment size.

Images are loaded from:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MichaelWBrennan/KONIVRER-deck-database/main/public/assets/cards/

This allows the main deployment to stay under Vercel's 100MB limit while still serving high-quality card images.
