## TypeScript Migration

The codebase has been prepared for migration to TypeScript, which provides better type safety, code completion, and maintainability.

### Running the Migration

To migrate the codebase to TypeScript, run:

```bash
# Dry run to see what would be changed without making actual changes
npm run migrate:ts:dry

# Interactive migration (asks for confirmation for each file)
npm run migrate:ts:interactive

# Full migration (converts all files)
npm run migrate:ts
```

### What the Migration Does

1. Converts `.js` and `.jsx` files to `.ts` and `.tsx`
2. Adds basic type annotations to functions, state, and props
3. Creates type definition files for core data structures
4. Updates imports and exports to use TypeScript syntax

### Manual Steps After Migration

After running the migration script, you may need to:

1. Fix any type errors that the script couldn't automatically resolve
2. Add more specific types to replace `any` types
3. Update component props interfaces with more specific types
4. Add proper return types to functions

## Build Optimization

The build process has been optimized for better performance and smaller bundle sizes.

### Running the Build Optimization

To optimize the build process, run:

```bash
# Apply build optimizations
npm run optimize:build

# Build with optimizations
npm run build:optimized

# Analyze the bundle
npm run build:analyze
```

### What the Build Optimization Does

1. Updates Vite configuration for better optimization
2. Implements code splitting for faster initial load times
3. Adds bundle analysis to identify large dependencies
4. Optimizes images and assets
5. Implements compression for production builds

## Performance Improvements

Several performance improvements have been implemented:

1. **Code Splitting**: Major components are loaded lazily
2. **Tree Shaking**: Unused code is eliminated from the bundle
3. **Memoization**: React components are memoized to prevent unnecessary re-renders
4. **Asset Optimization**: Images and other assets are optimized for faster loading
5. **Caching Strategies**: Proper caching strategies are implemented for API calls and assets

## Code Quality Enhancements

The codebase has been enhanced for better code quality:

1. **TypeScript**: Provides better type safety and code completion
2. **ESLint**: Enforces code style and catches potential issues
3. **Prettier**: Ensures consistent code formatting
4. **Strict Mode**: Enables strict type checking for better code quality
5. **Component Structure**: Improves component organization and reusability

## Troubleshooting

### TypeScript Migration Issues

If you encounter issues during the TypeScript migration:

1. Check the error messages in the console
2. Look for type errors in the codebase
3. Update type definitions as needed
4. Run `npm run type-check` to verify type correctness

### Build Optimization Issues

If you encounter issues during the build optimization:

1. Check the Vite configuration for errors
2. Verify that all dependencies are installed
3. Check for compatibility issues between dependencies
4. Run `npm run build` to see if the basic build works

### Performance Issues

If you encounter performance issues:

1. Run `npm run build:analyze` to identify large dependencies
2. Check for unnecessary re-renders using React DevTools
3. Verify that code splitting is working correctly
4. Check for memory leaks using browser DevTools

## Running the Complete Optimization

To run the complete optimization process:

```bash
npm run optimize:all
```

This will:

1. Migrate the codebase to TypeScript
2. Optimize the build process
3. Build the application with all optimizations

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you can optimize the KONIVRER Deck Database codebase for better performance, maintainability, and type safety. The optimization process is designed to be incremental, so you can apply the optimizations in stages as needed.
