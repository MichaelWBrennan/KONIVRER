- **Discriminated Unions**: Type-safe state management

#### ‚ö° **Modern TypeScript Features**
- **TypeScript 5.4+**: Latest language features and optimizations
- **Strict Mode**: All strict compiler options enabled
- **Advanced Types**: Conditional types, mapped types, and utility types
- **Type Guards**: Runtime type checking with compile-time benefits

#### üéØ **Developer Experience**
- **IntelliSense**: Full auto-completion and error detection
- **Compile-time Safety**: Catch errors before runtime
- **Better Refactoring**: Safe code transformations
- **Self-Documenting Code**: Types serve as living documentation

## üöÄ Technical Implementation

### Core Type Definitions

```typescript
// Card System Types
interface Card {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  elements: Element[];
  cost: number;
  type: 'Familiar' | 'Spell';
  keywords: Keyword[];
  text: string;
  image: string;
  rarity?: 'common' | 'uncommon' | 'rare' | 'mythic';
}

// Game State Types
interface GameState {
  turn: number;
  phase: 'start' | 'main' | 'combat' | 'refresh';
  activePlayer: 'player' | 'opponent';
  playerLifeCards: number;
  opponentLifeCards: number;
  // ... complete game state typing
}

// Player Types
interface Player {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  rating: number;
  wins: number;
  losses: number;
}
```

### Modern Component Architecture

```typescript
// Type-safe React components
const Home: React.FC = () => {
  const [playerStats] = React.useState<Player>({
    id: 'demo-player',
    name: 'TypeScript Developer',
    rating: 1500,
    wins: 42,
    losses: 13
  });

  // Fully typed feature definitions
  const features: Array<{
    title: string;
    description: string;
    icon: string;
    techStack: string[];
  }> = [
    // ... type-safe feature definitions
  ];

  return (
    // JSX with full type safety
  );
};
```

## üìä Migration Statistics
