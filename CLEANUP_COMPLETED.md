# Repository Cleanup Completed ✅

## Summary of Changes

This document summarizes the comprehensive cleanup and optimization performed on the KONIVRER Deck Database repository.

## 🌿 Branch Management
- **Merged and cleaned up all branches**
- Merged `feature/consolidate-workflows-fix-card-images-mit-compliance` into `main`
- Deleted the feature branch after successful merge
- Repository now has only the `main` branch (clean state)

## ⚖️ MIT License Compliance
- **All source files now have MIT license headers** (169/169 files compliant)
- Added license headers to 7 files that were missing them:
  - `src/engine/EnhancedRankingEngine.js`
  - `src/engine/AnalyticsEngine.js`
  - `src/components/PWAInstallPrompt.jsx`
  - `src/components/MobileAuthNotification.jsx`
  - `src/components/PlayerPerformanceAnalytics.jsx`
  - `src/components/TournamentMetaAnalysis.jsx`
  - `src/App.test.jsx`
- Verified `LICENSE` file exists with proper MIT license text
- Confirmed `package.json` has `"license": "MIT"` field

## 🤖 GitHub Actions Optimization
- **Removed 7 redundant workflow files** to eliminate duplicate functionality:
  1. `auto-fix-everything.yml` - Redundant with consolidated-automation
  2. `intelligent-issue-resolver.yml` - Redundant with consolidated-automation
  3. `self-healing-automation.yml` - Redundant and too frequent (every 15 minutes)
  4. `dependency-automation.yml` - Redundant with consolidated-automation
  5. `scheduled-maintenance.yml` - Redundant with consolidated-automation
  6. `passive-automation.yml` - Overlapped with consolidated-automation
  7. `proactive-monitoring.yml` - Can be consolidated

### Remaining Optimized Workflows
- ✅ `ci.yml` - Core CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ `consolidated-automation.yml` - Main automation suite
- ✅ `consolidated-security.yml` - Dedicated security suite
- ✅ `dependabot-auto-merge.yml` - Specific to Dependabot PRs
- ✅ `label.yml` - Simple labeling
- ✅ `prettier-fix.yml` - Code formatting
- ✅ `stale.yml` - Issue/PR cleanup

### Permission Optimization
- Reviewed all workflow permissions
- Confirmed no overly broad permissions
- Maintained principle of least privilege

## 🖼️ Card Image Fix (Previously Completed)
- Fixed card images to use local assets instead of CDN
- Updated CardDatabase.jsx with comprehensive name mappings

- All card images now served locally from `/assets/cards/`

## 📊 Impact Summary

- **Improved maintainability**: Cleaner workflow structure
- **Enhanced compliance**: 100% MIT license coverage
