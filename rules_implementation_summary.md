## Key Game Mechanics

### 1. Gameplay Structure
The game is divided into five phases:

0. **Pre Game Actions**
   - Place Flag in Flag zone
   - Shuffle deck
   - Set aside 4 Life Cards

1. **Start Phase**
   - Draw 2 cards (only at game start)
   - Optionally place 1 card as Azoth

2. **Main Phase**
   - Play cards using Azoth resources
   - Five play methods: Summon, Tribute, Azoth, Spell, Burst
   - Draw a card after each play

3. **Combat Phase**
   - Attack with Familiars
   - Defend with Familiars
   - Resolve combat damage

4. **Post-Combat Main Phase**
   - Play additional cards

5. **Refresh Phase**
   - Refresh all rested Azoth

### 2. Card Playing Methods

1. **Summon**
   - Play a Familiar with +1 counters equal to excess Azoth spent
   - Counters increase the Familiar's strength

2. **Tribute**
   - Reduce a card's cost by sacrificing Familiars
   - Cost reduction equals the combined element costs and counters

3. **Azoth**
   - Place a card face-up in Azoth Row as a resource
   - Each Azoth generates one element type at a time

4. **Spell**
   - Play a card for its effect, then put it on the bottom of the deck
   - Generic Azoth spent (⊗) determines effect strength

5. **Burst**
   - Play a card for free when drawn from Life Cards
   - ⊗ equals the number of remaining Life Cards
   - Keywords don't resolve

### 3. Resource System

The Azoth resource system works as follows:

1. Cards in the Azoth Row represent resources
2. Each Azoth card generates one element type
3. Azoth is "rested" (turned horizontally) when used
4. Rested Azoth is refreshed during the Refresh Phase
5. Players can place one card as Azoth during the Start Phase

### 4. Life Cards System

The Life Cards system replaces traditional health:

1. 4 face-down cards from the top of the deck
2. When a player takes damage, they reveal Life Cards
3. A player loses when all Life Cards are revealed
4. Revealed Life Cards can trigger Burst effects
