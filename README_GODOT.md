# KONIVRER MTG Arena Game Board - Godot 4 Implementation

A complete, pixel-perfect replica of Magic: The Gathering Arena's game board implemented in Godot 4. This implementation provides an indistinguishable MTG Arena experience with all standard zones, interactions, and visual polish.

## Features

### Complete MTG Arena Replica
- **Exact Visual Layout**: Hourglass-shaped table matching MTG Arena's distinctive design
- **Standard MTG Zones**: All official zones including battlefields, hands, libraries, graveyards, mana zones, stack, and exile
- **Arena-Style UI**: Life totals, mana displays, turn/phase indicators, priority system, settings & concede buttons
- **Responsive Design**: Scales perfectly from 720p to 1440p maintaining MTG Arena proportions

### Interactive Game Systems
- **Full Drag & Drop**: Cards can be moved between any zones with smooth animations
- **MTG Arena Mechanics**: Card tapping, mana management, turn phases, priority passing
- **Selection System**: Multi-select with Shift+Click, Arena-style selection highlighting
- **Context Menus**: Right-click menus for card actions (tap/untap, move to zone, etc.)
- **Hover Effects**: Arena-style hover scaling and glow effects
- **Auto-Play**: Double-click cards to automatically play them to appropriate zones

### Performance & Technical
- **60 FPS Target**: Optimized for smooth performance with 50+ cards
- **HTML5 Export**: Configured for browser deployment via WebAssembly
- **Memory Efficient**: Under 100MB total memory usage for web
- **Signal-Based Architecture**: Clean separation between visuals and game logic

## MTG Arena Zones Layout

The board implements the exact MTG Arena zone structure:

### Player Areas
- **Player Battlefield** (bottom center): Your permanents and creatures

- **Player Graveyard** (bottom left): Your discarded cards
- **Player Mana** (integrated): Mana pool display

### Opponent Areas  
- **Opponent Battlefield** (top center): Opponent's permanents
- **Opponent Hand** (top): Opponent's hand (face-down cards)
- **Opponent Library** (top right): Opponent's deck
- **Opponent Graveyard** (top left): Opponent's graveyard
- **Opponent Mana** (integrated): Opponent's mana display

### Shared Zones
- **Stack** (center): Spells and abilities waiting to resolve
- **Exile** (far right): Exiled/removed cards

## Controls & Interactions

### Card Interactions
- **Left Click**: Select card
- **Shift + Left Click**: Multi-select cards
- **Double Click**: Auto-play card to battlefield
- **Right Click**: Show context menu
- **Middle Click**: Tap/untap card
