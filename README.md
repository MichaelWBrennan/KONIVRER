#### Card Images

The repository includes placeholder card images for all 64 cards in the KONIVRER deck. These images are located in the `public/assets/cards/` directory and are available in both WebP and PNG formats. The WebP format is used as the primary format for better compression, while PNG is provided as a fallback for older browsers.

To add your own card images:
1. Create images with dimensions 412Ã—562 pixels
2. Save them with the card name as the filename (e.g., `ABISS.webp`, `ANGEL.png`)
3. Place them in the `public/assets/cards/` directory
4. The application will automatically use your images instead of the placeholders
