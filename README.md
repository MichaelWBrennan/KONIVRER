### 🐳 Even Easier with Docker (Truly Zero Setup)

```bash
# Start everything with Docker (ULTIMATE out-of-the-box)
docker-compose up

# Or build and run manually
docker build -t konivrer .
docker run -p 12000:12000 konivrer
```

### 📦 Traditional npm Commands (if you prefer)

```bash
# Install dependencies (auto-starts automation via postinstall)
npm install

# Start with ZERO HUMAN INTERACTION
npm run dev:autonomous

# Start with EVERY SECOND automation
npm run dev:every-second

# Start development with automation
npm run dev:auto

# Build for production
