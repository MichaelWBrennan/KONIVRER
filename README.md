#### Card Images

The repository includes placeholder card images for all 64 cards in the KONIVRER deck. These images are located in the `public/assets/cards/` directory and are available in both WebP and PNG formats. The WebP format is used as the primary format for better compression, while PNG is provided as a fallback for older browsers.

To add your own card images:
1. Create images with dimensions 412×562 pixels
2. Save them with the card name as the filename (e.g., `ABISS.webp`, `ANGEL.png`)
3. Place them in the `public/assets/cards/` directory
4. The application will automatically use your images instead of the placeholders

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Start with automation (recommended):**

   ```bash
   npm run dev:auto
   ```

4. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
