      {wrappedChildren}
    </AdvancedSecurityHealingProvider>
  );
}

if (config.enableQuantumSecurity) {
  wrappedChildren = (
    <QuantumSecurityProvider>

<SecurityIntegration 
  showDashboard={true} 
  silentMode={false} 
/>
```

### Optional: Access Security Metrics
```typescript
import { useSecurityContext } from './src/security/SecurityProvider';

const { getSecurityMetrics, performSecurityScan } = useSecurityContext();

// Get current security metrics
const metrics = getSecurityMetrics();

// Perform comprehensive security scan
const scanResult = await performSecurityScan();
```
