    content: `What is KONIVRER?
Set within an alternate history parallel to our own, KONIVRER (pronounced Conjurer) is a strategic, expandable card game made to simulate head-to-head battles where players take on the role of powerful magic users aptly named "Conjurers," of which this game takes its name. Build powerful decks representing your grimoire, the cards, and the pages within. Gods and monsters of legend inhabit this familiar yet new world.

Q&A:
Q: "So what's with the funky letters in the card names?"
A: "In this alternative history, one empire-sized butterfly effect had to occur to achieve a level of narrative cohesion and 'fantasy realism' that I was satisfied with having for this world to exist: Rome never came to power. Because of this, the modern-day alphabet of this world doesn't have the structure in our world and stays in a Latin-derived form very similar to Roman Square but with heavier Greek influence. Part 7 of this rulebook shows how this alphabet works."

Objective:
â€¢ Winning: Reduce your opponent's Life Cards to 0 by attacking with Familiars and Spells. Players can defend with their own Familiar to protect their Life Cards. The last player or team standing wins.

â€¢ 2Ã— sets of the 63-card intro set.
â€¢ Rulebook (this document)
â€¢ Optional: Dice to track counters (not included)

Game Details:
â€¢ Playtime: 30â€“60 minutes.
â€¢ Age: 12+
â€¢ Players: 2 or more (supports 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, free-for-all)
â€¢ Required: A flat playing surface (e.g., table)
