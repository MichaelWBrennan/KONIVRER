# Mystical Resonance: Revolutionary Card Mechanics

## What is Mystical Resonance?

Mystical Resonance is a groundbreaking new mechanic that allows cards to interact with each other in unprecedented ways. When cards share mystical energy, they can:

- **Amplify Effects**: Boost each other's power and abilities
- **Chain Reactions**: Trigger cascading effects across your deck
- **Elemental Synergy**: Combine different magical elements for unique results

## Featured Resonance Cards

### Fire Drake & Lightning Bolt
When played together, these cards create a **Thunderstorm** effect, dealing massive area damage.

### Water Guardian & Earth Shield
This combination creates an **Elemental Barrier** that provides both healing and protection.

## Strategic Implications

Mystical Resonance adds a new layer of deck-building strategy:
- Plan card combinations carefully
- Consider resonance chains in your deck construction
- Adapt your strategy based on opponent's resonance potential

Get ready to explore these new mechanics in upcoming tournaments!

# Master Deck Builder's Guide

## Core Principles

### 1. Mana Curve Optimization
Balance your deck's mana costs for consistent gameplay:
- **Early Game (1-3 mana)**: 30-40% of deck
- **Mid Game (4-6 mana)**: 40-50% of deck  
- **Late Game (7+ mana)**: 10-20% of deck

### 2. Synergy Over Power
Choose cards that work together rather than just powerful individual cards.

### 3. Win Condition Clarity
Every deck needs a clear path to victory:
- **Aggro**: Fast damage and pressure
- **Control**: Resource management and late-game power
- **Combo**: Specific card combinations for instant wins

## Advanced Techniques

### Resonance Chains
Plan 3-4 card combinations that create powerful resonance effects.

### Meta Adaptation
Adjust your deck based on popular strategies in the current meta.

### Sideboard Strategy
Prepare alternative cards for different matchups.

## Sample Deck: "Elemental Fury"

A balanced deck focusing on elemental synergies and resonance mechanics.

**Core Cards:**
- 3x Fire Drake
- 3x Lightning Bolt
- 2x Elemental Fusion
- 3x Mana Crystal

Build your path to mastery!
