```typescript
import { Player, GameRoom } from '../multiplayer/RealtimeMultiplayer';

export class GraphEmbedder {

    return players.map(player => this.embedPlayer(player, currentGameRoom));
  }

  private embedPlayer(player: Player, gameRoom: GameRoom): number[] {
    // Mock implementation â€” replace with real GNN logic
