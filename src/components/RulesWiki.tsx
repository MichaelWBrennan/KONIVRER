**Q: "So what's with the funky letters in the card names?"**

**A:** "In this alternative history, one empire-sized butterfly effect had to occur to achieve a level of narrative cohesion and 'fantasy realism' that I was satisfied with having for this world to exist: Rome never came to power. Because of this, the modern-day alphabet of this world doesn't have the structure in our world and stays in a Latin-derived form very similar to Roman Square but with heavier Greek influence. Part 7 of this rulebook shows how this alphabet works."`

      content: `# Gameplay Phases

The game is divided into several phases, repeated until one player or team remains:

## 0. Pre Game Actions
- Place your Flag on the top left corner of your play area
- Thoroughly shuffle your Deck and place it in the top right corner of your play area
- Take the top 4 cards of your Deck and place them in a stack below your Flag
- Do not look at these cards

## 1. Start Phase
- Draw 2 cards from your deck (only at the start of the game)
- Optionally place 1 card face up in your Azoth Row as a resource

## 2. Main Phase
- Play cards from your hand by resting Azoth (turning horizontally) to pay the costs of cards
- **Inherent**: All cards can be played via one of the conditions below

### Card Play Modes:
- **Summon**: Cards enter with +1 counters = the amount of Azoth paid for ‚ú°‚Éù if placed on the Field as a Familiar
- **Tribute**: If a card is Summoned, you may reduce the cost by the combined Elements costs and +1 counters of any number of Familiars you control, by removing them from the game
- **Azoth**: Place a card face-up in your Azoth Row. Each Azoth can only generate 1 type at a time
- **Spell**: Play a card from your hand but put it onto the bottom of your deck after resolving one of the abilities on the card
- **Burst**: You may play a card for free or put it in your hand when it's drawn from your life cards after you take damage

## 3. Combat Phase
- Attack with Familiars individually by placing them in the Combat Row

## 4. Post-Combat Main Phase
- Play additional cards if resources allow

## 5. Refresh Phase
- Refresh all rested Azoth sources (turning vertical)`

| Patient | Allowing time for others to process and respond | Waiting for translations, repeating when needed |
| Constructive | Focusing on solutions and improvement | Offering helpful feedback, suggesting alternatives |

- Connecting newcomers with resources and support

## Conflict Resolution and De-escalation

      content: `# Prohibited Behavior and Harassment

## Zero Tolerance Policy
KONIVRER has zero tolerance for harassment, discrimination, and harmful behavior. This policy applies regardless of intent‚Äîimpact matters more than intention.

## Forms of Harassment and Discrimination

| Category | Examples | Impact |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Verbal Harassment | Slurs, insults, threats, unwelcome comments about appearance/identity | Creates hostile environment, causes emotional harm |
| Physical Harassment | Unwanted touching, blocking movement, aggressive gestures | Violates personal boundaries, creates safety concerns |
| Sexual Harassment | Unwelcome sexual attention, comments, or advances | Creates unsafe environment, particularly for women and LGBTQIA+ individuals |
| Microaggressions | Subtle discriminatory comments or actions | Cumulative harm, exclusion, stereotype reinforcement |
| Cyberbullying | Online harassment, doxxing, coordinated attacks | Extends harm beyond physical spaces, affects mental health |
| Exclusionary Behavior | Deliberately excluding people from activities or conversations | Reinforces marginalization, prevents full participation |
| Cultural Insensitivity | Mocking accents, cultural practices, or religious observances | Devalues cultural identity, creates unwelcoming environment |

- Following or stalking behavior, online or offline
- Deliberately misgendering or deadnaming individuals
- Gatekeeping or questioning someone's right to participate
- Retaliation against those who report violations

## Intent vs. Impact
While we consider intent in our response to violations, the impact of behavior on community members is our primary concern. Saying 'I didn't mean it that way' does not excuse harmful behavior. We expect community members to:
- Take responsibility for the impact of their words and actions
- Apologize sincerely when they cause harm
- Learn from feedback and change their behavior
- Understand that good intentions don't negate harmful impact`

      content: `# Accessibility and Accommodations

## Universal Design Principles
We design our events and spaces to be accessible to as many people as possible from the start, rather than retrofitting accommodations. This includes:
- Physical accessibility (ramps, wide doorways, accessible seating)
- Sensory considerations (lighting, sound levels, quiet spaces)
- Cognitive accessibility (clear signage, simple navigation)
- Communication accessibility (multiple formats, interpretation)

## Types of Accommodations

| Disability Type | Common Accommodations | Implementation |
|----------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Mobility | Wheelchair access, reserved seating, assistance with materials | Accessible venues, volunteer support |
| Visual | Large print materials, screen readers, audio descriptions | Digital accessibility, alternative formats |
| Hearing | Sign language interpreters, captioning, visual alerts | Professional interpreters, assistive technology |
| Cognitive | Extended time, simplified instructions, memory aids | Flexible policies, clear communication |
| Neurological | Seizure precautions, medication breaks, quiet spaces | Medical awareness, environmental controls |
| Mental Health | Emotional support, break areas, flexible participation | Trained staff, supportive environment |
| Chronic Illness | Flexible scheduling, rest areas, medical accommodations | Understanding policies, health support |

## Requesting Accommodations
The accommodation request process is designed to be simple and respectful:
- Requests can be made at any time, though advance notice is helpful
- No medical documentation required for most accommodations
- Requests are handled confidentially by trained staff
- Interactive process to determine effective accommodations
- Regular check-ins to ensure accommodations are working

## Neurodiversity and Inclusion
We recognize and celebrate neurodiversity, understanding that neurological differences are natural variations. We support neurodiverse community members by:
- Providing sensory-friendly environments and quiet spaces
- Offering multiple ways to participate and communicate
- Training staff on neurodiversity awareness
- Avoiding assumptions about communication styles or behaviors
- Celebrating different ways of thinking and problem-solving`
