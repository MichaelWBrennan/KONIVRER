**Q: "So what's with the funky letters in the card names?"**

**A:** "In this alternative history, one empire-sized butterfly effect had to occur to achieve a level of narrative cohesion and 'fantasy realism' that I was satisfied with having for this world to exist: Rome never came to power. Because of this, the modern-day alphabet of this world doesn't have the structure in our world and stays in a Latin-derived form very similar to Roman Square but with heavier Greek influence. Part 7 of this rulebook shows how this alphabet works."`

      keywords: ["phases", "pre-game", "start", "main", "combat", "post-combat", "refresh"],
      content: `# Gameplay Phases

The game is divided into several phases, repeated until one player or team remains:

## 0. Pre Game Actions
- Place your Flag on the top left corner of your play area
- Thoroughly shuffle your Deck and place it in the top right corner of your play area
- Take the top 4 cards of your Deck and place them in a stack below your Flag
- Do not look at these cards

## 1. Start Phase
- Draw 2 cards from your deck (only at the start of the game)
- Optionally place 1 card face up in your Azoth Row as a resource

## 2. Main Phase
- Play cards from your hand by resting Azoth (turning horizontally) to pay the costs of cards
- **Inherent**: All cards can be played via one of the conditions below

### Card Play Modes:
- **Summon**: Cards enter with +1 counters = the amount of Azoth paid for ‚ú°‚Éù if placed on the Field as a Familiar
- **Tribute**: If a card is Summoned, you may reduce the cost by the combined Elements costs and +1 counters of any number of Familiars you control, by removing them from the game
- **Azoth**: Place a card face-up in your Azoth Row. Each Azoth can only generate 1 type at a time
- **Spell**: Play a card from your hand but put it onto the bottom of your deck after resolving one of the abilities on the card; Use the amount of Azoth paid for ‚ú°‚Éù in place of the Element symbol in the ability's text
- **Burst**: You may play a card for free or put it in your hand when it's drawn from your life cards after you take damage. ‚ú°‚Éù = the number of life cards you have left when you play the card this way (this does not include itself,) and its keywords do not resolve
- **Resolve Keywords**
- **Draw a card** after each time you play a card

## 3. Combat Phase
- Attack with Familiars individually by placing them in the Combat Row

## 4. Post-Combat Main Phase
- Play additional cards if resources allow

## 5. Refresh Phase
- Refresh all rested Azoth sources (turning vertical)`

The Dynamic Resolution Chain (DRC) is the system used to resolve spells and abilities in KONIVRER. This system ensures that all effects are resolved in the correct order and that players have opportunities to respond to each other's actions.

## How the DRC Works
- Effects are added to the chain in the order they are played
- The chain resolves in last-in, first-out order
- Players can respond to effects on the chain
- Each player must pass priority for the chain to resolve
- Some effects can change the order of resolution

## Priority System
- Active player receives priority at start of each phase
- Players may respond to spells and abilities with priority
- Stack resolves in last-in, first-out order
- Both players must pass priority for phases to end
- State-based actions checked whenever player gains priority`

Each activates only once on the play of the respective Spell/Familiar.

## Amalgam
**Summoned**: Choose one of the two listed Keywords when you play the card. The card gains that Keyword and its linked Element while it's in play.

**Azoth**: Choose one of the two listed Elements when you play the card as an Azoth Source. While in play, the card can generate that Element whenever it is exhausted.

## Brilliance
Place target Familiar with +1 Counters or Spell with Strength ‚â§ ‚≠ò used to pay for this card's Strength on the bottom of its owner's life cards. (doesn't affect ‚ñ¢ cards)

## Gust
Return target Familiar with +1 Counters or Spell with Strength ‚â§ üúÅ used to pay for this card's Strength to its owner's hand. (doesn't affect üúÉ cards)

## Inferno
After damage is dealt to the target card, add damage ‚â§ üúÇ used to pay for this card's Strength. (doesn't affect üúÑ cards)

## Steadfast
Redirect damage ‚â§ üúÉ used to pay for this card's Strength, that would be done to you or cards you control, to this card's Strength. (doesn't affect üúÇ cards)

## Submerged
Place target Familiar with +1 Counters or Spell with Strength ‚â§ üúÑ used to pay for this card's Strength, that many cards below the top of its owner's deck (doesn't affect üúÅ cards)

## Quintessence
This card can't be played as a Familiar. While in the Azoth row, it produces any Azoth type.

| Respectful | Treating others with courtesy and consideration | Using please/thank you, listening actively |
| Inclusive | Using language that welcomes all people | Avoiding gendered assumptions, using inclusive terms |

- Being patient with questions and learning curves
- Connecting newcomers with resources and support

## Conflict Resolution and De-escalation
When conflicts arise, community members should:
- Remain calm and avoid escalating tensions
- Listen to understand, not just to respond
- Focus on the behavior or issue, not personal attacks
- Seek to find common ground and solutions
- Involve mediators or staff when needed
- Take breaks if emotions are running high`

      category: "conduct",
      keywords: ["harassment", "discrimination", "zero tolerance", "prohibited", "microaggressions"],
      content: `# Prohibited Behavior and Harassment

## Zero Tolerance Policy
KONIVRER has zero tolerance for harassment, discrimination, and harmful behavior. This policy applies regardless of intent‚Äîimpact matters more than intention.

## Forms of Harassment and Discrimination

| Category | Examples | Impact |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Verbal Harassment | Slurs, insults, threats, unwelcome comments about appearance/identity | Creates hostile environment, causes emotional harm |
| Physical Harassment | Unwanted touching, blocking movement, aggressive gestures | Violates personal boundaries, creates safety concerns |
| Sexual Harassment | Unwelcome sexual attention, comments, or advances | Creates unsafe environment, particularly for women and LGBTQIA+ individuals |
| Microaggressions | Subtle discriminatory comments or actions | Cumulative harm, exclusion, stereotype reinforcement |
| Cyberbullying | Online harassment, doxxing, coordinated attacks | Extends harm beyond physical spaces, affects mental health |
| Exclusionary Behavior | Deliberately excluding people from activities or conversations | Reinforces marginalization, prevents full participation |
| Cultural Insensitivity | Mocking accents, cultural practices, or religious observances | Devalues cultural identity, creates unwelcoming environment |
| Ableism | Mocking disabilities, refusing accommodations, using disability as insult | Excludes disabled community members, perpetuates stigma |

## Specific Prohibited Language and Behavior

### Language Violations:
- Slurs or derogatory terms targeting any group or identity
- Hate speech or language promoting violence against groups

## Intent vs. Impact
While we consider intent in our response to violations, the impact of behavior on community members is our primary concern. Saying 'I didn't mean it that way' does not excuse harmful behavior. We expect community members to:
- Take responsibility for the impact of their words and actions
- Apologize sincerely when they cause harm
- Learn from feedback and change their behavior
- Understand that good intentions don't negate harmful impact`

| Chronic Illness | Flexible scheduling, rest areas, medical accommodations | Understanding policies, health support |

## Requesting Accommodations
The accommodation request process is designed to be simple and respectful:

- No medical documentation required for most accommodations

- Celebrating different ways of thinking and problem-solving`
