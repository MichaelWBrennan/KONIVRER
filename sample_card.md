## Card Explanation

This sample card "ABISS" demonstrates all the parts of a KONIVRER card:

1. **Element(s)**: △△⊗ - Requires two Fire elements plus generic Azoth to cast
2. **Name**: ABISS - The card's title
3. **Lesser Type**: FAMILIAR - This card is a creature that can attack and defend
4. **Ability(s)**:
   - Enter-the-field effect: Deal 2 damage to target Familiar
   - Void keyword ability: Remove target card from play
5. **Flavor Text**: Quote from Genesis 1:2, providing thematic context
6. **Set and Rarity Symbol**: ☽-Ω - Uncommon card from the Omega set
7. **Set Number**: 1/63 - First card in a set of 63 cards

## In-Game Representation

When this card is played:
1. It costs two Fire Azoth plus any additional generic Azoth the player wishes to spend
2. The additional generic Azoth determines its initial Strength
3. When it enters the field, its ability triggers, dealing 2 damage to a target Familiar
4. If its Void ability is activated, it can remove a card from play (sending it to the Removed from Play zone)
5. As a Familiar, it can attack and defend in the Combat Row

## Elemental Significance

The Fire element (△) alignment gives this card:
- Aggressive capabilities
- Potential synergy with other Fire cards
- Bonus effects when played with a Fire-aligned Flag

## Strategic Use

ABISS is best used:
- As an early removal tool for opponent's small Familiars
- In Fire-focused decks for elemental synergy
- When you need to permanently remove problematic cards via its Void ability
