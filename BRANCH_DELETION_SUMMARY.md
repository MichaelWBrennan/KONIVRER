## Execution Options

### Option 1: GitHub Actions (Recommended)
1. Go to repository Actions tab
2. Run "üóëÔ∏è Delete Closed PR Branches" workflow
3. Start with dry-run mode to verify
4. Then run with confirmation to actually delete

### Option 2: Local Script
```bash
./cleanup-closed-branches.sh
```

### Option 3: Manual Commands
Run the individual `git push origin --delete <branch>` commands listed in the documentation.

## Safety Guarantees
- ‚úÖ **No code loss**: All merged changes preserved in main branch
- ‚úÖ **Open PRs preserved**: All active development continues unaffected
- ‚úÖ **Rollback possible**: Branches can be recreated if needed
- ‚úÖ **Full documentation**: Complete audit trail of what was deleted

## Expected Result
After execution:
- **67% reduction** in branch count (15 ‚Üí 5 branches)
- **Clean repository structure** with only active branches
- **Improved developer experience** with less clutter
- **Better maintainability** going forward

## Status
üü° **Ready for execution** - All tools and documentation provided, awaiting user confirmation to proceed with branch deletion.
