# Self-Healing System

This repository includes an advanced self-healing system that automatically detects and fixes common issues, including TypeScript errors.

## Features

- **Automated TypeScript Error Fixing**: Automatically detects and fixes TypeScript errors
- **Daily Scheduled Runs**: Runs every day to keep the codebase clean
- **Pull Request Creation**: Creates PRs with fixes for review
- **Intelligent Error Prioritization**: Focuses on files with the most errors first
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Provides detailed reports of fixed and remaining errors

## How It Works

1. The system runs on a schedule (daily by default)
2. It scans the codebase for TypeScript errors
3. It applies intelligent fixes to common error patterns
4. It creates a branch with the fixes
5. It submits a pull request for review
6. It creates an issue if some errors couldn't be fixed automatically

## Configuration

The self-healing system is configured in `.github/self-healing-config.json`. Key TypeScript-related settings:

```json
"typescriptErrors": {
  "enabled": true,
  "autoFix": true,
  "createPullRequest": true,
  "scheduleFrequency": "daily",
  "fixStrategies": [
    "add-missing-types",
    "fix-syntax-errors",
    "create-interfaces",
    "fix-implicit-any"
  ],
  "maxErrorsPerRun": 500,
  "prioritizeFiles": true
}
```

## Manual Triggering

You can manually trigger the TypeScript auto-fix process:

1. **Using GitHub Actions**: Go to the Actions tab, select "TypeScript Auto-Fix" workflow, and click "Run workflow"
2. **Using npm script**: Run `npm run fix:typescript` locally
3. **Using cron script**: Run `scripts/cron-typescript-fix.sh` locally

## Customization

To customize the auto-fix behavior:

1. Modify `.github/workflows/typescript-auto-fix.yml` for workflow settings
2. Edit `scripts/fix-typescript-errors.js` to change error fixing strategies
3. Update `.github/self-healing-config.json` for configuration options

## Monitoring

The system provides several ways to monitor its activity:

- GitHub Actions logs show detailed information about each run
- Pull requests include summaries of fixed and remaining errors
- Issues are created for errors that couldn't be fixed automatically

## Troubleshooting

If the auto-fix system isn't working as expected:

1. Check the GitHub Actions logs for errors
2. Verify that the TypeScript configuration is correct
3. Ensure the repository has the necessary permissions for creating branches and PRs
4. Check that the self-healing configuration has TypeScript fixing enabled
