## Installation & Setup

The AI Recorder is already integrated into the KONIVRER project. No additional installation is required.

### Configuration

The recorder uses `ai-recorder.config.js` for configuration. Key settings include:

```javascript
{
  recording: {
    enabled: true,
    autoStart: false,
    watchFiles: true,
    includeGitDiff: true
  },
  watch: {
    include: ['src/**/*', 'scripts/**/*'],
    exclude: ['node_modules/**', 'ai-logs/**']
  }
}
```

## Usage

### Starting a Recording Session

```bash
# Start interactive recording session
npm run ai:start

# Start recording with development server
npm run dev:ai
```

### Recording Activities

```bash
# Record a general activity
npm run ai:activity "feature" "Implementing card search functionality"

# Record a decision
npm run ai:decision "Use React hooks" "Better state management and cleaner code"

# Record performance metrics
npm run ai:performance "buildTime" "15000"

# Record security events
npm run ai:security "vulnerability" "Fixed XSS vulnerability in search component"
```

### Running Commands with Recording

```bash
# Run build with recording
npm run build:ai

# Run tests with recording
npm run test:ai

# Run any command with recording
npm run ai:run "npm run lint"
```

### Ending a Session

```bash
# End current session and generate summary
npm run ai:stop

# Generate summary without ending session
npm run ai:summary
```

## Output Structure

### Session Files

Each recording session creates several files in the `ai-logs/` directory:

```
ai-logs/
â”œâ”€â”€ session-ai-1234567890-abc123.json    # Detailed session data
â”œâ”€â”€ ai-development-summary.md            # Human-readable summary
â””â”€â”€ ai-metrics.json                      # Aggregated metrics
```

### Session Data Structure

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Automated Recording

The AI Recorder integrates seamlessly with existing development tools:

- **Vite Development Server**: Automatically records HMR events and build times
- **Git Operations**: Tracks commits, branch changes, and code diffs
- **NPM Scripts**: Records script execution and performance
- **File System**: Monitors file changes in real-time

### CI/CD Integration

The recorder can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions integration
- name: Run tests with AI recording
  run: npm run test:ai

- name: Build with AI recording
  run: npm run build:ai

- name: Upload AI logs
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: ai-development-logs
    path: ai-logs/
```

## Best Practices

### 1. **Descriptive Activity Logging**
```bash
# Good
npm run ai:activity "feature" "Implementing responsive card grid with infinite scroll"

# Better
npm run ai:activity "feature" "Implementing responsive card grid with infinite scroll to improve mobile UX and reduce initial load time"
```

### 2. **Decision Documentation**
Always document the reasoning behind significant decisions:
```bash
npm run ai:decision "Use Framer Motion for animations" "Provides better performance than CSS transitions and includes gesture support needed for mobile interactions"
```

### 3. **Performance Tracking**
Record performance metrics at key milestones:
```bash
npm run ai:performance "bundleSize" "2.1MB"
npm run ai:performance "loadTime" "850ms"
```

### 4. **Security Awareness**
Document security-related changes:
```bash
npm run ai:security "fix" "Added input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks"
```

## Advanced Features

### Custom Activity Types

You can define custom activity types in the configuration:

```javascript
activities: {
  types: [
    'feature',
    'bugfix',
    'refactor',
    'optimization',
    'security',
    'testing',
    'documentation',
    'deployment',
    'maintenance',
    'ai-training',      // Custom type
    'user-feedback'     // Custom type
  ]
}
```

### Performance Thresholds

Set performance thresholds to automatically flag issues:

```javascript
performance: {
  thresholds: {
    buildTime: 30000,     // Flag builds over 30 seconds
    testDuration: 60000,  // Flag test runs over 1 minute
    bundleSize: 5000000   // Flag bundles over 5MB
  }
}
```

### Webhook Integration

Configure webhooks for external integrations:

```javascript
notifications: {
  webhook: {
    enabled: true,
    url: 'https://your-webhook-endpoint.com/ai-events',
    events: ['session_start', 'session_end', 'security_event']
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Errors**
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/ai-recorder.js
   ```

2. **File Watching Issues**
   - Check that the `ai-logs` directory is writable
   - Ensure file paths in config are correct

3. **Git Integration Problems**
   - Verify git is installed and repository is initialized
   - Check git permissions

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging:
```bash
DEBUG=ai-recorder npm run ai:start
```
