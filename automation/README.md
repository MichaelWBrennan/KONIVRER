## Architecture

The KONIVRER Automation System consists of several key components:

1. **Orchestrator**: The core engine that coordinates all automation activities.
2. **File Watcher**: Monitors file changes and triggers appropriate actions.
3. **Task Runners**: Specialized modules for running specific tasks (linting, testing, etc.).
4. **Self-Healing Engine**: Automatically fixes common issues.
5. **AI Analysis Engine**: Provides intelligent suggestions and optimizations.
6. **Dashboard**: Visual interface for monitoring the system.
7. **CLI**: Command-line interface for interacting with the system.

## Configuration

The automation system is highly configurable. The main configuration file is located at `automation/config.ts`.

Key configuration options:

- `watchMode`: Enable/disable file watching
- `autoFix`: Enable/disable automatic fixing of issues
- `autoCommit`: Enable/disable automatic committing of changes
- `autoOptimize`: Enable/disable automatic performance optimization
- `aiEnabled`: Enable/disable AI-powered analysis
- `notificationsEnabled`: Enable/disable notifications
- `notificationChannels`: Configure notification channels (console, system, Slack, etc.)

## CI/CD Integration

The automation system integrates seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines:

- **GitHub Actions**: Workflow configuration in `.github/workflows/automation.yml`
- **GitLab CI**: Configuration in `.gitlab-ci.yml`
- **Jenkins**: Configuration in `Jenkinsfile`

## Best Practices

- **Let the system work**: Trust the automation system to handle routine tasks.
- **Review suggestions**: While the system can fix many issues automatically, review AI suggestions for complex optimizations.
- **Monitor the dashboard**: Regularly check the dashboard for insights and trends.
- **Customize for your needs**: Adjust the configuration to match your project's specific requirements.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the automation system:

1. Check the logs: `npm run automation:logs`
2. Verify configuration: `npm run automation:config`
3. Restart the system: `npm run automation:stop && npm run automation:start`
