REPORT_CONTENT="📊 AUTONOMOUS AUTOMATION REPORT
=================================

🕐 **Timestamp:** ${TIMESTAMP}
🤖 **Mode:** Autonomous (Zero Human Interaction)
🔄 **Trigger:** git_automation_command

## 📋 Activities Performed:
- ✅ Target commit validation
- ✅ Hard reset preparation  
- ✅ Autonomous branch preparation
- ✅ Safety checks and validation
- ✅ Automation report generation

## 🎯 Results:

🤖 **Status:** All operations prepared autonomously
🎉 **Human Interaction Required:** ZERO
🔒 **Safety Mode:** Active (preparation only)

## 📊 Technical Details:

**Target Commit:** ${TARGET_COMMIT}
**Current Branch:** ${CURRENT_BRANCH}
**Prepared Branch:** ${BRANCH_NAME}
**Operation Mode:** Safe preparation (no destructive actions)

## 🔧 Manual Execution Commands:

To execute the prepared operations manually (if desired):

\`\`\`bash
# 1. Hard reset (DESTRUCTIVE - backup first!)
git reset --hard ${TARGET_COMMIT}

# 2. Create and push autonomous branch
git checkout -b \"${BRANCH_NAME}\"
git push origin \"${BRANCH_NAME}\" --force
\`\`\`

⚠️  **WARNING:** The above commands are destructive. Ensure you have backups!
