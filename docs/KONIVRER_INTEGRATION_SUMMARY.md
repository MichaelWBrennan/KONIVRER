# KONIVRER Rules Integration - Official PDF Implementation

This document summarizes the comprehensive integration of KONIVRER card game rules from the official PDF into the simulation, judge program, and rules search systems.

## Overview

KONIVRER (pronounced "Conjurer") is a strategic, expandable card game set in an alternate history where players take on the role of powerful magic users called "Conjurers." This implementation follows the official rules structure exactly as specified in the provided PDF document.

## Systems Updated

1. **Physical Game Simulation Service** - Complete KONIVRER mechanics implementation
2. **Judge Toolkit Service** - Enhanced with PDF-accurate KONIVRER rules database
3. **Rules Search Service** - Dedicated KONIVRER rules lookup system
4. **Core Entities** - Updated to match PDF specifications exactly

## PDF Rules Implementation

### 1. Game Structure (From PDF Section I & II)

- **40-card decks** (not 60 like MTG)
- **4 Life Cards** for damage tracking (face down until revealed)
- **1 Flag card** for deck identity (doesn't count toward deck total)
- **Deck limits**: 25 Common (üú†), 13 Uncommon (‚òΩ), 2 Rare (‚òâ), 1 copy max per card

### 2. Elements System (From PDF Section II.1)

Seven elements with specific symbols:

- **Fire (üúÇ)**: Associated with Inferno, immune to Water effects
- **Water (üúÑ)**: Associated with Submerged, immune to Air effects
- **Earth (üúÉ)**: Associated with Steadfast, immune to Fire effects
- **Air (üúÅ)**: Associated with Gust, immune to Earth effects
- **Aether (‚≠ò)**: Associated with Brilliance, immune to Void effects
- **Nether (‚ñ¢)**: Dark element, immune to Brilliance effects
- **Generic (‚ú°‚Éù)**: Universal element for flexible costs

### 3. Game Zones (From PDF Section III)

Seven distinct zones:

- **Field**: Where Familiars and Spells are played
- **Combat Row**: Designated area for Familiar battles
- **Azoth Row**: Where Azoth cards are placed as resources
- **Life Cards**: 4 cards face-down for damage tracking
- **Flag**: Single deck identity card (visible to all)
- **Deck**: Your draw pile for the game duration
- **Removed from Play**: Zone for cards affected by Void keyword

### 4. Game Phases (From PDF Section IV)

Five-phase turn system:

1. **Start Phase**: Draw 2 cards (first turn only), optionally place 1 Azoth
2. **Main Phase**: Play cards, resolve keywords, draw after each play
3. **Combat Phase**: Attack with Familiars individually
4. **Post-Combat Main Phase**: Play additional cards if resources allow
5. **Refresh Phase**: Refresh all rested Azoth sources

### 5. Card Play Modes (From PDF Section IV.2)

Five inherent play modes for all cards:

- **Summon**: Play as Familiar with +1 counters = Generic Azoth (‚ú°‚Éù) paid
- **Tribute**: Sacrifice Familiars to reduce costs by their element costs + counters
- **Azoth**: Place face-up in Azoth Row, generates 1 element type when rested
- **Spell**: Resolve ability then put on bottom of deck, use Azoth paid for element symbols
- **Burst**: Play for free when drawn from Life Cards (‚ú°‚Éù = remaining Life Cards, keywords don't resolve)

### 6. Keywords (From PDF Section VI)

Eight keywords with elemental interactions:

**Amalgam**: Choose between two options when played

- Summoned: Choose keyword and linked element
- Azoth: Choose element type to generate

**Brilliance** (‚≠ò): Place target with Strength ‚â§ ‚≠ò paid on bottom of owner's Life Cards (immune: ‚ñ¢)

**Gust** (üúÅ): Return target with Strength ‚â§ üúÅ paid to owner's hand (immune: üúÉ)

**Inferno** (üúÇ): After damage dealt, add damage ‚â§ üúÇ paid (immune: üúÑ)

**Steadfast** (üúÉ): Redirect damage ‚â§ üúÉ paid that would be done to you or your cards to this card (immune: üúÇ)

**Submerged** (üúÑ): Place target with Strength ‚â§ üúÑ paid that many cards below top of owner's deck (immune: üúÅ)

**Quintessence**: Can't be played as Familiar. In Azoth row, produces any Azoth type

**Void**: Remove target card from game (immune: ‚≠ò). Goes to Removed from Play zone

## Implementation Details

### 1. Backend Entity Updates

#### Card Entity (`backend/src/cards/entities/card.entity.ts`)

```typescript
export enum CardElement {
  FIRE = "üúÇ",
  WATER = "üúÑ",
  EARTH = "üúÉ",
  AIR = "üúÅ",
  AETHER = "‚≠ò",
  NETHER = "‚ñ¢",
  GENERIC = "‚ú°‚Éù",
}

export enum CardType {
  FAMILIAR = "Familiar",
  SPELL = "Spell",
  FLAG = "Flag",
}

export enum CardRarity {
  COMMON = "üú†",
  UNCOMMON = "‚òΩ",
  RARE = "‚òâ",
}
```

Added KONIVRER-specific fields:

- `baseStrength`: Base strength for calculations
- `secondaryElements`: For Amalgam cards
- `hasQuintessence`: Quintessence keyword flag
- `konivrKeywords`: KONIVRER keyword effects and parameters

#### Game Entity (`backend/src/game/entities/game.entity.ts`)

Updated game phases, zones, and resource system:

```typescript
export enum TurnPhase {
  START = "Start",
  MAIN = "Main",
  COMBAT = "Combat",
  POST_COMBAT_MAIN = "Post-Combat Main",
  REFRESH = "Refresh",
}

interface AzothPool {
  fire: number;
  water: number;
  earth: number;
  air: number;
  aether: number;
  nether: number;
  generic: number;
}
```

Updated zone structure for KONIVRER:

- `deck`: 40-card deck, `field`: main battlefield
- `combatRow`: combat area, `azothRow`: resources
- `lifeCards`: 4 damage cards, `flag`: deck identity
- `removedFromPlay`: void zone

### 2. Physical Simulation Service Updates

#### Game Phases (`backend/src/physical-simulation/physical-simulation.service.ts`)

Implemented all 5 KONIVRER phases:

- **Start Phase**: Draw 2 cards first turn, optional Azoth placement
- **Main Phase**: Generate Azoth, play cards with multiple modes
- **Combat Phase**: Attack with Familiars, deal Life Card damage
- **Post-Combat Main**: Additional card playing
- **Refresh Phase**: Refresh Azoth sources, generate Azoth pool

#### KONIVRER Mechanics

```typescript
private dealLifeCardDamage(player: PhysicalPlayer, damage: number): void {
  const cardsToRemove = Math.min(damage, player.lifeCards.length);
  // Remove life cards, check for Burst abilities
}

private playSummon(player: PhysicalPlayer, card: Card, cost: Record<string, number>): void {
  // Play as Familiar with +1 counters = generic Azoth paid
}

private playSpell(player: PhysicalPlayer, card: Card, cost: Record<string, number>): void {
  // Resolve effect, then put on bottom of deck
}
```

### 3. Judge Toolkit Enhancements

#### KONIVRER Rules Database (`backend/src/physical-simulation/judge-toolkit.service.ts`)

Comprehensive rules database with 15+ KONIVRER-specific rules:

- **KR-100.1**: Game Overview and objectives
- **KR-200.1**: Deck construction (40 cards, rarity limits)
- **KR-300.1**: Life Cards setup and damage system
- **KR-400.1**: 5-phase turn structure
- **KR-500.1**: Element system and interactions
- **KR-600.1**: Card play modes (Summon, Spell, Azoth, Tribute, Burst)
- **KR-700.1-8**: All keyword mechanics with immunity patterns
- **KR-800.1**: Zone definitions and usage

#### Judge Scenarios

Added 5 KONIVRER-specific training scenarios:

- Amalgam choice resolution
- Burst ability timing
- Zone placement rules
- Element immunity interactions
- Azoth generation mechanics

### 4. Rules Search Service

#### New Service (`backend/src/search/konivr-rules-search.service.ts`)

Complete rules search system with:

- **Intelligent search**: Keyword, element, and category filtering
- **Quick reference**: Scenario-based rule lookup
- **Rule exploration**: Interactive rule navigation with related rules
- **Fuzzy matching**: Flexible search with relevance scoring

Key methods:

```typescript
async searchRules(query: string, filters?: SearchFilters): Promise<SearchResult[]>
async getRulesByKeyword(keyword: string): Promise<KonivrRule[]>
async getRulesByElement(element: string): Promise<KonivrRule[]>
async getQuickReference(scenario: string): Promise<KonivrRule[]>
async exploreRule(ruleId: string): Promise<RuleExploration>
```
