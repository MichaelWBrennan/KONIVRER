# KONIVRER Detailed Gameplay Mechanics

This document provides in-depth explanations of KONIVRER's unique gameplay mechanics based on the official rules.

## Card Playing Methods (Inherent System)

All cards in KONIVRER can be played via one of several inherent methods, providing strategic flexibility:

### 1. Summon
- **Purpose**: Play cards as Familiars on the Field
- **Mechanics**: 
  - Cards enter with +1 counters equal to the amount of Azoth paid for ⊗ (Generic cost)
  - The more Generic Azoth you spend beyond the required cost, the stronger the Familiar becomes
- **Strategic Use**: Primary method for deploying creatures for combat

**Example**: A card costs △△⊗ (2 Fire + 1 Generic). If you pay 2 Fire + 3 Generic Azoth, the Familiar enters with +2 counters (3 Generic paid - 1 required = 2 extra).

### 2. Tribute
- **Purpose**: Reduce casting costs by sacrificing existing Familiars
- **Mechanics**:
  - Only available when Summoning a card
  - Reduce the cost by the combined Element costs and +1 counters of any number of Familiars you control
  - Sacrificed Familiars are removed from the game (not discarded)
- **Strategic Use**: Enables powerful plays by converting board presence into cost reduction

**Example**: You want to Summon a card costing △△△⊡⊡⊗⊗ (3 Fire + 2 Earth + 2 Generic). You control a Familiar with △⊡ cost and +2 counters. You can Tribute it to reduce the cost by △⊡ + 2 Generic, making the new cost △△⊡⊗⊗.

### 3. Azoth
- **Purpose**: Generate resources for future turns
- **Mechanics**:
  - Place a card face-up in your Azoth Row
  - Each Azoth card can only generate 1 element type at a time
  - Azoth cards can be "rested" (turned horizontal) to generate their element
- **Strategic Use**: Build up resources for expensive plays, establish elemental diversity

**Example**: Playing a card with △▽⊡ elements as Azoth allows you to generate Fire, Water, OR Earth (choose one each time you rest it).

### 4. Spell
- **Purpose**: Use cards for immediate effects without permanent board presence
- **Mechanics**:
  - Play a card from your hand and resolve one of its abilities
  - After resolving, put the card on the bottom of your deck (not discarded)
  - Use the amount of Azoth paid for ⊗ in place of Element symbols in the ability text
- **Strategic Use**: Flexible effects that can be scaled with additional Azoth investment

**Example**: A card's ability reads "Deal △ damage to target Familiar." If you play it as a Spell and pay 3 Generic Azoth for ⊗, it deals 3 damage instead of 1.

### 5. Burst
- **Purpose**: Emergency plays when taking damage
- **Mechanics**:
  - Only available when a card is drawn from your Life Cards after taking damage
  - Play the card for free OR put it in your hand
  - ⊗ equals the number of Life Cards you have left (not including the card itself)
  - Keywords on the card do not resolve when played via Burst
- **Strategic Use**: Turn disadvantageous situations into opportunities

**Example**: You have 2 Life Cards left and take 1 damage, revealing a card. You can Burst it for free, and any ⊗ in its abilities equals 1 (your remaining Life Cards).

## Azoth System Deep Dive

### Azoth Generation
- **Primary Method**: Place cards face-up in your Azoth Row
- **Resting**: Turn Azoth cards horizontal to generate their element types
- **Refreshing**: During Refresh Phase, turn all rested Azoth vertical again

### Azoth Types and Costs
- **Specific Elements**: △ (Fire), ▽ (Water), ⊡ (Earth), △ (Air), ○ (Aether), □ (Nether)
- **Generic (⊗)**: Can be paid with any element type
- **Mixed Costs**: Cards can require multiple element types

### Strategic Azoth Management
1. **Curve Planning**: Balance cheap and expensive cards in your deck
2. **Element Diversity**: Include multiple element types for flexibility
3. **Azoth Timing**: Decide when to play cards as Azoth vs. other methods
4. **Resource Denial**: Consider opponent's Azoth when planning attacks

## Turn Sequence Details

### Start Phase Specifics
- **First Turn Only**: Draw 2 cards (subsequent turns follow different draw rules)
- **Azoth Choice**: Placing a card in Azoth Row is optional but recommended for resource development
- **No Refresh**: Azoth placed this turn is immediately available (not rested)

### Main Phase Interactions
- **Card Draw Trigger**: Draw a card after each card you play (not after each ability resolves)
- **Keyword Resolution**: Some keywords trigger immediately, others have delayed effects
- **Multiple Plays**: Can play multiple cards in sequence if you have sufficient Azoth

### Combat Phase Mechanics
- **Individual Attacks**: Each Familiar attacks separately, not as a group
- **Combat Row**: Attacking Familiars are placed in a designated Combat Row area
- **Blocking Assignment**: Defending player chooses which of their Familiars block which attackers
- **Damage Calculation**: Based on Familiar strength/power values plus any modifiers

### Post-Combat Main Phase
- **Second Main**: Opportunity to play additional cards after combat
- **Response Window**: Can respond to combat results with appropriate cards
- **Resource Management**: Consider remaining Azoth for defensive plays

### Refresh Phase
- **Azoth Reset**: All rested Azoth becomes available again
- **Cleanup**: Resolve any end-of-turn effects
- **Turn Transition**: Active player passes to opponent

## Advanced Interactions

### Keyword Timing
- **Immediate Keywords**: Resolve as soon as the card is played
- **Triggered Keywords**: Activate when specific conditions are met
- **Continuous Keywords**: Provide ongoing effects while the card is in play

### Stack Resolution
- **Last In, First Out**: Most recent effect resolves first
- **Response Windows**: Players can respond to effects before they resolve
- **Priority System**: Active player has first opportunity to play effects

### Life Card Interactions
- **Damage Prevention**: Some effects can prevent Life Card loss
- **Life Card Manipulation**: Certain cards can interact with Life Cards directly
- **Burst Opportunities**: Taking damage can provide unexpected resources via Burst

## Deck Building Implications

### Azoth Curve
- **Low Cost**: Include cards that can be played early for board presence
- **Mid Cost**: Balanced cards that provide good value
- **High Cost**: Powerful effects that can win games

### Element Distribution
- **Primary Elements**: Focus on 1-2 elements for consistency
- **Splash Elements**: Include small amounts of other elements for specific cards
- **Generic Costs**: Balance specific and generic costs for flexibility

### Card Type Balance
- **Familiars**: Core of most strategies, provide board presence
- **Utility Cards**: Cards that work well as Spells or Azoth
- **Situational Cards**: Powerful effects for specific scenarios

## Conclusion

KONIVRER's inherent system provides unprecedented strategic depth by allowing every card to serve multiple purposes. Mastering when to use each method - Summon, Tribute, Azoth, Spell, or Burst - is key to success in this innovative trading card game.
