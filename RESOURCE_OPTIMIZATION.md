# KONIVRER Deck Database - Resource Optimization

This document outlines the resource optimization strategies implemented in the KONIVRER Deck Database application to ensure efficient operation and prevent SIGKILL errors.

## Frontend Optimizations

### Loading Screen
- Added a resource-optimized loading screen that displays system resource information
- Provides visual feedback during application initialization
- Automatically disappears when the application is ready

## Backend Automation Optimizations

### Configuration
- CPU usage limited to 50%
- Memory usage limited to 80%
- Disk I/O operations reduced through batched logging
- Throttling under high system load

### Interval Optimizations
- Monitoring interval: 60 seconds (previously 1 second)
- TypeScript checks: Every 60 seconds
- Security scans: Every 3600 seconds (1 hour)
- Performance checks: Every 1800 seconds (30 minutes)
- Quality checks: Every 900 seconds (15 minutes)
- Quick heal: Every 600 seconds (10 minutes)
- Full auto-heal: Every 3600 seconds (1 hour)

### Resource Monitoring
- System resource usage is monitored every 10 cycles
- Automatic throttling when resource usage exceeds thresholds
- Log verbosity is reduced during high resource usage

### Logging Optimizations
- Batched log writes to reduce disk I/O
- Configurable log verbosity levels
- Logs are flushed periodically rather than on every operation

### Command Execution
- Commands are executed with reduced CPU and I/O priority
- Timeout limits to prevent hanging processes
- Commands are skipped during high system load

## Continuous Automation Service

### Service Configuration
- Check interval increased from 1 second to 60 seconds
- Auto-heal process runs hourly instead of every cycle
- Resource monitoring occurs every 5 minutes
- Resource threshold lowered to 80% to prevent hitting system limits

### Status Monitoring
- Enhanced status check script to display resource optimization settings
- Real-time resource usage reporting
- Automatic throttling based on system load

## Benefits

- Significantly reduced CPU usage
- Lower memory footprint
- Reduced disk I/O operations
- Prevention of SIGKILL errors due to resource exhaustion
- More stable and reliable continuous automation
- Improved overall system performance

## Implementation

The resource optimization has been implemented across the entire codebase:

1. Frontend React application
2. Backend automation system
3. Continuous service scripts
4. Status monitoring tools

All changes maintain full functionality while ensuring efficient resource usage.
