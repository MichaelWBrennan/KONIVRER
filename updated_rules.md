## Game Setup
Players begin the game by completing the Pre Game Actions outlined in the Gameplay Structure below. There are no traditional health points - instead, players use the Life Cards system where losing all 4 Life Cards results in defeat.

    - **Tribute**: If a card is Summoned, you may reduce the cost by the combined Elements costs and +1 counters of any number of Familiars you control, by removing them from the game.
    - **Azoth**: Place a card face-up in your Azoth Row. Each Azoth can only generate 1 type at a time.
    - **Spell**: Play a card from your hand but put it onto the bottom of your deck after resolving one of the abilities on the card; Use the amount of Azoth paid for âŠ— in place of the Element symbol in the ability's text.
    - **Burst**: You may play a card for free or put it in your hand when it's drawn from your life cards after you take damage. âŠ— = the number of life cards you have left when you play the card this way (this does not include itself), and its keywords do not resolve.
