## 🧩 Advanced Decision Making

### Multi-Criteria Evaluation System

Each AI decision is evaluated across multiple dimensions:

- **Immediate Value**: Direct board impact
- **Strategic Value**: Long-term positioning
- **Risk Assessment**: Potential downsides
- **Synergy**: Combo potential with other cards
- **Surprise Factor**: Unpredictability value
- **Efficiency**: Resource optimization

### Power Cost Optimization

The AI intelligently chooses generic cost levels when playing Elementals:

- Analyzes available resources
- Considers board state and threats
- Balances immediate power vs. future plays
- Adapts to opponent's strategy
- Personality influences cost preferences

### Adaptive Learning

The AI learns and adapts during gameplay:

- **Player Behavior Profiling**: Tracks aggression, resource conservation, favorite elements
- **Strategy Counter-Adaptation**: Adjusts to counter player patterns
- **Mistake Learning**: Remembers failed strategies
- **Success Reinforcement**: Repeats successful plays

## 🎭 Human-Like Behavior

### Dynamic Mood System

AI mood affects decision-making:

- **Confident**: After successful plays, takes more risks
- **Frustrated**: After mistakes, may play suboptimally
- **Focused**: Neutral state, balanced decisions
- **Pressure Response**: Makes mistakes under pressure

### Realistic Thinking Patterns

- **Variable Thinking Time**: Based on complexity and personality
- **Occasional Mistakes**: Human-like imperfection
- **Confidence-Based Decisions**: May choose suboptimal plays when uncertain
- **Experimentation**: Tries new strategies in low-stakes situations

### Personality-Driven Dialogue

Each AI has unique responses:
- Victory celebrations
- Mistake reactions
- Strategic comments
- Mood-based expressions
