```

### Field Searches
```
c:red                   # Cards with red in their color
color:red               # Same as above (full field name)
cmc:3                   # Cards with converted mana cost 3
cmc>=4                  # Cards with CMC 4 or higher
cmc<=2                  # Cards with CMC 2 or lower
t:creature              # Creature cards
type:creature           # Same as above
o:flying                # Cards with "flying" in oracle text
oracle:flying           # Same as above
pow>=4                  # Creatures with power 4 or greater
tou<=2                  # Creatures with toughness 2 or less
r:rare                  # Rare cards
rarity:rare             # Same as above
s:knv                   # Cards from KONIVRER Core set

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Basic Integration
```tsx
import SearchIntegration from './src/search/SearchIntegration';

function App() {
  const handleCardSelect = (card: KonivrCard) => {
    console.log('Selected card:', card);
  };

  return (
    <SearchIntegration 
      onCardSelect={handleCardSelect}
      initialCards={myCardDatabase}
    />
  );
}
```

### Advanced Usage
```tsx
import ScryfallSearchEngine from './src/search/ScryfallSearchEngine';
import ScryfallSearchInterface from './src/search/ScryfallSearchInterface';

function CustomSearch() {
  const [searchEngine] = useState(() => new ScryfallSearchEngine(cards));
  
  const handleSearchResults = (results) => {
    console.log(`Found ${results.totalCount} cards in ${results.searchTime}ms`);
  };

  return (
    <ScryfallSearchInterface
      searchEngine={searchEngine}
      onSearchResults={handleSearchResults}
      showAdvancedFilters={true}
      showSortOptions={true}
      maxResults={100}
    />
  );
}
```

### Programmatic Search
```typescript
const searchEngine = new ScryfallSearchEngine(cards);

// Simple search
const results = searchEngine.search('c:red cmc:3');

// Advanced search with filters
const advancedResults = searchEngine.search('t:creature', {
  filters: {
    colors: ['red', 'green'],
    cmc: { min: 2, max: 5 },
    power: { min: 3 }
  },
  sort: { field: 'power', direction: 'desc' },
  pageSize: 20
});

// Auto-complete
const suggestions = searchEngine.getAutocompleteSuggestions('light');
