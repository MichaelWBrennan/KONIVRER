# KONIVRER Self-Healing and Self-Optimizing System

This document describes the self-healing and self-optimizing capabilities implemented in the KONIVRER Deck Database application.

## Overview

The KONIVRER application now includes advanced self-healing and self-optimizing capabilities that allow it to:

1. Automatically detect and recover from errors
2. Optimize performance based on runtime metrics
3. Adapt to different environments and usage patterns
4. Prevent crashes and data loss
5. Provide insights into application health

## Self-Healing Capabilities

### Error Boundaries

The application is wrapped in a self-healing error boundary that:

- Catches and logs errors that would otherwise crash the application
- Attempts to recover from errors automatically
- Provides fallback UI when recovery isn't possible
- Tracks error statistics and recovery rates

### Network Recovery

The `useNetworkRecovery` hook provides:

- Automatic retries for failed network requests
- Exponential backoff to prevent overwhelming servers
- Configurable retry limits and delays
- Error tracking and reporting

### State Recovery

The `useStateRecovery` hook provides:

- Automatic state persistence to prevent data loss
- Recovery of state after crashes or page reloads
- Fallback to initial state when corruption is detected
- Configurable storage options (localStorage, sessionStorage)

### Error Monitoring

The application includes comprehensive error monitoring:

- Global error tracking across the entire application
- Error statistics and recovery rate tracking
- Detailed error information for debugging
- Optional error reporting to external services

## Self-Optimizing Capabilities

### Performance Monitoring

The application continuously monitors key performance metrics:

- Frames per second (FPS)
- Memory usage
- Network latency
- Render times
- Resource usage

### Adaptive Optimization

Based on the monitored metrics, the application can:

- Optimize rendering when FPS drops
- Clean up memory when usage is high
- Adjust network request patterns based on latency
- Optimize component rendering based on performance

### Component Optimization

The `withOptimization` higher-order component provides:

- Automatic memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Performance tracking for individual components
- Lazy loading capabilities
- Render time optimization

## Configuration

The self-healing and self-optimizing system is highly configurable through the `src/core/auto-config.json` file:

```json
{
  "selfHealing": {
    "enabled": true,
    "maxRecoveryAttempts": 5,
    "recoveryDelay": 1000,
    ...
  },
  "selfOptimizing": {
    "enabled": true,
    "monitoringInterval": 5000,
    ...
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Wrapping Components with Error Boundaries

```jsx
import { SelfHealingErrorBoundary } from './core/SelfHealer';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <SelfHealingErrorBoundary>
      <ComponentThatMightError />
    </SelfHealingErrorBoundary>
  );
}
```

### Using Network Recovery

```jsx
import { useNetworkRecovery } from './core/SelfHealer';

function DataFetcher() {
  const fetchData = () => fetch('/api/data').then(res => res.json());
  
  const { execute, data, loading, error, retryCount } = useNetworkRecovery(fetchData, {
    maxRetries: 3,
    retryDelay: 1000,
    onSuccess: (data) => console.log('Data loaded successfully', data),
    onError: (error) => console.error('Failed to load data', error),
    onRetry: (attempt) => console.log(`Retry attempt ${attempt}`)
  });
  
  useEffect(() => {
    execute();
  }, [execute]);
  
  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;
  
  return <div>{JSON.stringify(data)}</div>;
}
```

### Using State Recovery

```jsx
import { useStateRecovery } from './core/SelfHealer';

function PersistentForm() {
  const { state, setState, resetState } = useStateRecovery(
    { name: '', email: '' },
    'form-data',
    { enableLocalStorage: true }
  );
  
  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    // Submit form data
    resetState(); // Clear form after submission
  };
  
  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input
        value={state.name}
        onChange={(e) => setState({ ...state, name: e.target.value })}
      />
      <input
        value={state.email}
        onChange={(e) => setState({ ...state, email: e.target.value })}
      />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

### Optimizing Components

```jsx
import { withOptimization } from './core/SelfOptimizer';

const ExpensiveComponent = ({ data }) => {
  // Expensive rendering logic
  return <div>{/* Rendered content */}</div>;
};

// Create an optimized version of the component
const OptimizedComponent = withOptimization(ExpensiveComponent, {
  name: 'ExpensiveComponent',
  memoize: true
});

// Use the optimized component instead
function App() {
  return <OptimizedComponent data={someData} />;
}
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

In development mode, the application includes visual monitors:

- Performance Monitor: Shows FPS, memory usage, and other metrics
- Error Statistics: Shows error counts and recovery rates

These can be enabled in production by setting the appropriate flags in the configuration.

## Benefits

The self-healing and self-optimizing system provides several benefits:

1. **Improved Stability**: The application can recover from errors that would otherwise cause crashes
2. **Better Performance**: Automatic optimization based on runtime metrics
3. **Enhanced User Experience**: Fewer errors and smoother performance
4. **Reduced Data Loss**: State recovery prevents losing user data during errors
5. **Easier Debugging**: Comprehensive error tracking and performance monitoring

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements to the system include:

1. Machine learning-based optimization strategies
2. Predictive error prevention
3. Advanced telemetry and reporting
4. Integration with external monitoring services
5. Automated code optimization based on usage patterns
