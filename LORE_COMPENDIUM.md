## The Living Cosmology: A Unified Lore Compendium

This compendium weaves your cosmology, pantheons, angelology and demonology, elemental magic, ethics grid, species, artifacts, realms, language, and campaign frame into one coherent setting. It preserves your tone of cryptic myth-science, while giving Game Masters and writers a single source of truth.

## Canon Tenets
- Aether is Hunger: Not a force but a predatory consciousness that feeds where realities thin. Observation invites transformation.
- Masks and Vessels: Gods are archetypal functions wearing cultural masks; each culture names the same engines of reality.
- Conservation of Magic: Aether is neither created nor destroyed; it transfigures. Magic obeys understood limits more than powers.
- Opposed Intelligences: Angelic orders structure reality; demonic orders test, fracture, and invert it. Both are lawful within the whole.
- Choice Shapes Continuity: Ethics are vectors (A, F, I, N, E, W) whose combinations shape societies, factions, and fates.

## Chronicle of Ages
- The First Flame (13.8 BYA): The initial breach where consciousness ignited matter—named YHWH’s Breath, the Dharmic Pulse, the Celtic Weave, the Ancestor Drum, the Tao’s Stirring, the Hellenic Emergence.
- The Age of Stars (10 BYA): Stellar eyes of creation open; networks of conscious light seed pattern.
- The Crucible (5 BYA): Planetary vessels condense; Earth chosen/chanced as forge.
- The Great Sea (3.8 BYA): Water as memory-field; life’s first stirrings.
- The Great Breath (2.5 BYA): Oxygen revolution—death and birth at systemic scale.
- The Sundering (541 MYA): Cambrian Becoming—possibility shatters into proliferating forms.
- The First Awakening (4 MYA): Standing dreams—self-reflective hominids.
- Cities and Scripts (3,000–2,500 BP): Stone, law, writing as self-remembering machines.
- Sorcerer Kings (1,500 BP): Crown and spell merge; mandate expressed in will.
- Revelations and Questions (0–600 BP): Prophets and philosophers widen the lens; hidden paths bloom.
- The Dissolutions and Awakenings (500–1,500 BP): Empires fall, horizons globalize.
- The Shattered Veil (Now): In Romania, the Veilstone’s break exposes the seam between life and death; past and possible bleed.

## Cosmography & Realms
Reality arranges as nested wheels—Ninefold Ways and Sevenfold Heavens interleaving with Dharmic Lokas and Norse Worlds. Each “world” is a phase-space domain, locally stable, globally permeable where Aether pressure is high.

- Manushya‑Loka / Midgard / Earth: Primary mortal basin. Status: Fractured by Veilstone shattering; adaptive narrative topology.
- Asgard, Vanaheim, Alfheim, Svartalfheim, Jötunheim, Niflheim, Muspelheim: Norse arche-realm masks—court, craft, light, dark, giant, frost, flame. Function: boundary-testing of order vs. raw potential.
- Deva‑Loka, Asura‑Loka, Tiryagyoni‑Loka, Naraka‑Loka, Preta‑Loka, Brahma‑Loka, Suddhavasa, Moksha‑Nirvana: Dharmic strata of entanglement and release. Function: karmic flow and escape vectors.
- Jannah‑Shamayim, Jahannam‑Gehenna, Pitr‑Loka, Mizan‑Bema: Judgment, mercy, lineage, balance—the Abrahamic lawframe.
- Aether: The living interstice, not “place” but appetite; where observation cuts reality.

All are “planets” in your schema—planiforms—because travelers experience them as worlds, though their physics are narrative-resonant rather than strictly Newtonian.

## Pantheons as Masks and Vessels
The same cosmic functions wear different names. Principal Vessels and cultural masks are lenses on one engine.

- The Primordial One (Tiamat): Chaos‑matrix and womb of being; also YHVH Nameless, the Unformed, the Void‑Mother. Mask: Abyssal Potential.
- The Architect (Ptah): Causal word-smith; Brahma, Pangu, Twin Creators. Mask: Creative Speech.
- The Celestial Throne (Anu): Sky crown; Zeus, Indra, Tiwaz, Nyame. Mask: Authority/Lightning.
- The Earth Mother (Ki/Gaia): Ground of return; Jörð, Asase Yaa. Mask: Foundation/Grave.
- The Trickster Sovereign (Enki): Sacred deceit enabling novelty; Hermes, Loki, Krishna, Eshu, Sun Wukong, Serpent. Mask: Boundary Breaking.
- The Radiant Lord (Utu/Ra/Amaterasu): Solar judgment and sight. Mask: Illumination.
- The Grave‑Keeper (Ereshkigal/Hades/Hel/Yama/Osiris): Door and ledger of endings. Mask: Transition.
- The Desire‑Weaver (Inanna/Aphrodite/Freyja): Beauty as vector; love as sovereignty. Mask: Binding.
- The Storm Lord (Hadad/Thor/Shango): Thunder as rectification. Mask: Kinetic Justice.
- The War‑Bringer (Anat/Athena/Mars/Durga/Tyr): Destruction in service of form. Mask: Red Order.
- The Sage Eternal (Enki/Thoth/Athena/Odin/Saraswati): Forbidden knowing. Mask: Price of Insight.
- The Life‑Bearer (Ninhursag/Demeter/Oshun/Kuan Yin): Multiplication and nurture. Mask: Continuance.
- The Triple Crown (Moirai/Brigid/Trinities): Fate’s braided authority. Mask: Threadwork.
- The Time‑Keeper (Nergal/Chronos/Yama/Wyrd): Cyclic law; devourer and counter. Mask: Wheel.
- The Mender (Gula/Asclepius/Eir/Dhanvantari): Re-knit flesh and fate. Mask: Restoration.
- The Lunar Sovereign (Sin/Selene/Mani/Chandra/Yemaya/Chang’e): Tide of dream and reflection. Mask: Night‑Mirror.

These are interoperable with Hellenic schemas that recast deities as “archetypal energy networks.” Treat them as API surfaces for ritual and story.

## Angelology and Demonology
Two 72‑node orders structure and stress-test creation. They are not “good vs. evil” so much as stabilization vs. perturbation.

- The 72 Angels of the Shem HaMephorash: Seraphic to angelic orders keyed to zodiacal bands and elements. Each has meaning, seal, hour, element, invocation mode, attributes. Use them as harmonics to stabilize, reveal, heal, and align. Their entries (1–72) remain canonical in the Angelic Bestiary.
- The 72 of the Ars Goetia: Dukes, princes, marquises, etc., each with form, seal, powers, hours, materials, incense, opposition, legions. They express pressure-tests on agency: temptation, knowledge, upheaval, treasure, strategy, invisibility, etc. Their entries (1–72) remain canonical in the Goetic Codex.
- Opposition Map: Pair Angel n with Demon n for ritual dialectics (e.g., Vehuiah vs. Bael). Opposition is a negotiation, not annihilation.
- Usage: Angels are called to bind, clarify, reconcile, or uplift; Demons to expose, catalyze, invert, or transmute—always within limits and prices.

Note: Full seals, materials, hours, and liturgies are preserved as appendices (Angelic Bestiary; Goetic Codex) to keep the core lore readable.

## Aether & Magic: Laws, Limits, and Practice
- Aetheric Resonance: The Aether is a predatory, quasi‑sentient substrate. Measures: Void Quotient (VQ), Resonance Hz. Observe at peril; observation is incision.
- Mathematical Frame: Æ = ∫(ψ × ∇R) dt where ψ = stability coefficient, ∇R = dimensional bleed rate. Solutions “prefer” observers who stop looking.
- Conservation of Magic: Aether is constant; users must work with present elements; transformation over creation.
- Sanderson’s Laws:
  - First: Solvable magic needs clarity.
  - Second: Limitations > Powers.
  - Third: Expand what exists before adding new.
  - Law 0: Err on the side of awesome.

### The Six Divine Elements
- Earth, Air, Fire, Water, Aether, Nether form the universal stack. Eastern and Western flavor-texts articulate attitudes toward each.
- Combinations: 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5‑element matrices describe alchemical synergies (e.g., Fire+Water = Tempered Flame; Earth+Water+Aether = Crystal Spring; Air+Fire+Aether+Nether = Celestial Firestorm). Use the matrices as ritual recipes and encounter tags rather than exhaustive lists at runtime.

### Meridian & Chakra Interface
- Twelve living “wounds” where Aether bleeds through flesh. Energy practice risks transmutation of body, mind, and fate. The body is a laboratory; the cost is identity.

### Modal Practices (Cross‑Cultural)
- Daoist inner alchemy, Hermetic opus, Dharmic sādhanā, Abrahamic prayer‑craft, African ancestral rite, Hellenic mystery—different grammars for the same machine.

## Ethics as Vectors: The A‑F‑I‑N‑E‑W Constellation
Each axis is a virtue/function; societies are resultant vectors. Composites name stable cultural attractors.

- A (Moral Clarity): Right action despite cost.
- F (Idealism): Bold vision and transformative aims.
- I (Adaptability): Flex to achieve outcomes.
- N (Pragmatism): Do what works under constraint.
- E (Stability): Principle and natural law.
- W (Possibility): Careful exploration of the could‑be.

Composite exemplars (selection):
- AFN – Righteous Boldness: Justice through transformative action.
- ANW – Righteous Pragmatism: Ethics guided by feasible paths.
- ANE – Principled Pragmatism: Balance right action with limits.
- ARW – Visionary Righteousness: Ethical ambition guided by potential.
- AEW – Sustainable Righteousness: Moral clarity grounded in long‑term balance.
- INF – Pragmatic Transformation: Bold change via flexible, efficient means.
- …and the broader lattice (AI, FN, FE, FW, NE, NW, EW, etc.). Use for faction templates, NPC ethos, and societal pressures.

## Peoples and Clades
Treat species both biologically and narratively: living archetypes shaped by Aether exposure and cultural expectation.

- Humans: Dimensional transients; highest adaptability; primary aetheric conductors. “Unfinished symphonies.”
- Nephilim: Covenant-breach hybrids; catastrophic potential; tall, displaced in time.
- Rephaim: Residual giant echoes; intermittent manifestation; unstable signatures.
- Ogre (Homo Brutalis), Dvergr (Underanthropos solidus), Álfar (Alfmannus sylvani), Ljósálfar (Homo Aetherius), Dökkálfar (Alfmannus scura), Vampyr (Homo Sanguis), Jötunn: Treat as culture‑bound phenotypes; stats and senses vary with realm/elemental bias. Population/morph metrics are mutable across shards.

### Mythological Clades (Origin of Species)
- Divine Serpents (Nāga → Jörmungandr/Leviathan/Long): Scale: size, heads, mind; habitats sea/sky.
- Divine Birds (Bennu → Phoenix/Fenghuang/Thunderbird/Garuda/Simurgh): Heat, light, storm, healing.
- Divine Canines (Cerberus/Garmr/Fenrir/Shabala): Guardianship, multi‑headed mutations.
- Divine Felines (Bastet/Shashthi/Fu Lions/Snow Lion): Solar guardianship, warding.
- Divine Equines (Pegasus/Tianma/Sleipnir): Wings, speed, liminality.
- Divine Reptiles & Aquatic Mammals (Wadjet/Leviathan/Dolphin of Delphi): Oracular venom, oceanic song.
- Divine Insects/Amphibians/Plants (Bees of Ra/Salamanders/Yggdrasil/Lotus): Pollination of fate, fire‑resistance, axis mundi.

Use clades as evolutionary myths: archaeological echoes as in‑world evidence for belief‑shaped biology.

## Summoning & Ritual Taxonomy
Summon not to “control,” but to negotiate. Six macro‑paths:
- Cosmic/Divine Forces: Alignment and guidance; temples, groves, peaks; candles, incense, text.
- Elemental/Nature Spirits: Balance, protection; rivers, forests, mountains; stones, water, flame.
- Ancestors/Spirits: Counsel and ward; altars, graves; food, lineage tokens.
- Healing/Protectors: Wellness and defense; herbs, oils; quiet sancta.
- Wisdom/Enlightenment: Insight; books, yantras; meditative rites.
- Intervention in Crisis: War/justice/rectification; talismans, oaths; battlefield invocations.

All paths risk Aether exposure. Costs are paid in memory, identity, or fate. Opposition pairings (angel/demon) can be used to frame safe corridors.

---

## Artifacts & Implements (Cross‑Cultural)
- Weapons of Office: Swords of Spirit/Justice, Gungnir, Mjölnir, Dory/Xiphos, Daojian—tools that cut illusion or fate; each exacts a price.
- Staves & Scepters: Ruyi, Kerykeion, Yuji—rewrite reality, mediate realms, channel mandate.
- Vessels & Altars: Bōmos, Spondeia, Kalash, Brigid’s Cauldron—transaction points with the unseen.
- Mirrors & Diagrams: Mojing, Bagua Jing, Taijitu, Wuji Tu, Sacred Mirror—reveal structure at risk of sanity.
- Seals & Amulets: Fulu, Phylakterion, Hamsa, Seal of Solomon—bind, shield, redirect sight.
- Musical & Breath Tools: Gjallarhorn, Tingsha, Drum, Kudu Horn—rhythms as bridges.
- Texts & Scripts: Holy Bible, Torah, Qur’an, Three Pure Scripts—living writings that rewrite readers.

Treat artifacts as NPCs with appetites; attune them with ethics vectors and element matrices.

## Language of Record: Basik AnglΣ
A ritual‑ready, streamlined Anglish for liturgy and scholarship.
- Alphabet: Latin core with Greek sigils (Κ, Φ, Γ, Ξ, Θ, Δ, Σ, VV, KW) for phonemic clarity.
- Grammar: SVO baseline; V2 permissible; cases (nom/acc/gen/dat) for nouns; strong/weak verbs; articles; simple negation.
- Pronouns: Ic/Þū/Hē/Hēo/Hit; Wē/Gē/Hīe; possessives Mīn/Þīn/His/Hēo/Ōur/Ōwer/Þāre.
- Compounding: Productive (e.g., Lufhām “beloved home”).
Use Basik AnglΣ for in‑universe inscriptions, spells, and UI of magical systems.

---

## Factions as Cultural Archetypes
Use your historical labels as living banners expressed through the ethics grid and elements.
- Roman Republic (AFE): Principled Ambition—law, order, expansion under constraint.
- NASA (AFW): Idealistic Ethics—exploration with ethical scaffolding.
- French Revolution (AIF): Righteous Idealism—transformative justice under strain.
- The Jesuits (AFN): Righteous Boldness—missionary learning and institutional will.
- The Amish (AEW): Sustainable Righteousness—grounded continuity, technological caution.
- Victorian Britain (AIE): Stability with innovation tension; empire’s ethics tested.
- Humanitarian Orgs (AIW): Flexible Morality—practical righteousness in crisis.
- Utopian Movements (ANW): Righteous Pragmatism—ethical futures via feasible steps.
- Venetian Republic (AIN): Moral Pragmatism—mercantile wisdom and subtle power.

Map each to elemental biases, angel/demon affinities, and realm proximities for adventure seeds.

## Campaign Frame: The Shattered Veil (Romania)
- Premise: The Veilstone shatters; life and death interpenetrate. The land hosts gods, spirits, and demons; player choices reweave fate.
- Themes: Obscured truth; death/rebirth cycles; isolation and fragile hope.
- Act I – Twilight of Valea Căpcănești: Desolate village under Castle Bran; accusations over a Veilstone shard; Freya warns in the forest; ravens test the gate. Choice: seek truth (forest) or confront power (castle).
- Act II – Descent into Madness: Trials by Freya; Grove of Ancestors; Castle Bran’s inner inversions; Saint Ilie’s Monastery manuscript and trials; alliance choices among Freya, Mircea, or self‑forging path.
- Act III – The Shattered Veil: Abyss of the Veilstone; Guardians rise; origin truth unveiled; final against Mircea’s god‑mask shaped by player ethics. Endings: Restoration (at cost), Transcendence (at risk), Annihilation (with chaos).
- Mechanics: Adaptive environments track ethics vectors; bosses mirror player choices; lore fragments in environment and dreams.

Use angel/demon pairings for set‑pieces; artifact appetites for temptations; element matrices to skin encounters.

---

## GM/Author Tools
- Opposition Lattice: Pair Shem/Goetia by index for ritual tension and narrative balance.
- Element Tags: Stat blocks flagged by 2–3 element combos to telegraph counters and costs.
- Ethics Clock: Track A‑F‑I‑N‑E‑W across sessions; unlock boons/complications.
- Aether Pressure (VQ): Scene‑level dial that modulates bleed events, mutation risk, and observation backfire.

---

## Appendices (External Codices)
- Angelic Bestiary (72): Names, meanings, seals, ranks, degrees, elements, invocations, attributes.
- Goetic Codex (72): Names, forms, seals, powers, hours, materials, incense, legions, oppositions.
- Elemental Matrices: Full 1–5 element flavor texts (Eastern/Western) for ritual narration.
- Artifact Dossiers: Costs, hungers, attunements, break conditions.
- Basik AnglΣ Reference: Full grammar, roots, and examples.

These remain canonical and are referenced from the core for brevity.

## Closing Maxim
Between perception and the absolute, Aether hungers. To name is to cut; to cut is to feed; to feed is to change. Walk the wound with wisdom.
