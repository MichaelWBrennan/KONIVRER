# 🔍 Analytics & Speed Insights Troubleshooting Guide

## 🚨 Common Issue: No Data Showing

If you're seeing no data in Vercel Analytics or Speed Insights, here are the most likely causes and solutions:

## 1. **Deployment Environment** ⚠️ MOST COMMON ISSUE

### Problem
Analytics and Speed Insights **ONLY work in production** on Vercel-hosted domains.

### Solution
- ✅ **Deploy to Vercel** - Analytics won't work on localhost or other hosting
- ✅ **Use production domain** - Must be a Vercel domain (*.vercel.app or custom domain)
- ✅ **Wait for deployment** - Changes need to be deployed to take effect

## 2. **Data Collection Delay** ⏱️

### Problem
Analytics data can take **24-48 hours** to appear in the dashboard.

### Solution
- ✅ **Wait 24-48 hours** after first deployment
- ✅ **Generate traffic** - Visit pages, click buttons, navigate around
- ✅ **Check again later** - Data appears gradually

## 3. **Vercel Project Configuration** ⚙️

### Problem
Analytics might not be enabled in your Vercel project settings.

### Solution
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings** → **Analytics**
4. Ensure **Analytics** is enabled
5. Ensure **Speed Insights** is enabled
6. Check **Domain verification** status

## 🛠️ **Quick Verification**

Run this command to verify your setup:
```bash
npm run analytics:verify
```

## 📊 **Manual Testing**

In your browser console on the deployed site:
```javascript
// Check if analytics are loaded
console.log('Vercel Analytics:', !!window.va);
console.log('Speed Insights:', !!window.vitals);

// Test analytics manually
if (window.va) {
  window.va('track', 'test_event', { test: true });
}
```
